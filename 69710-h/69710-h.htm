<p><span class="smcap">These</span> articles appeared this year in the April,
August, and September numbers of <i>The Nineteenth
Century and After</i>, and I have to thank the Editor
for allowing me to reprint them so soon after publication.
They are a justification of the much-attacked
Order in Council of 11th March, 1915.</p>

<p>In reply to the German submarine menace
the British Government resorted, by way of Reprisals,
to a method of strangling the enemy’s
commerce which, on the one hand, was wider
in its scope than any list of contraband, and, on
the other, was free from the ‘legal niceties’ which
surround a declaration of blockade. Neutral
merchants declared that it hit them hard, and
the Government of the United States protested
that it exceeded the limits which international
law has placed to the right of a belligerent to
interfere with neutral trade. The British Government
replied justifying its action, and there,
one would imagine, the matter should have
rested for arbitration after the War. But the
Government of the United States has continued
its protests, has indeed just renewed them in most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
vigorous language, desiring to deflect us, in the
interests of its commerce, from a course which
must materially assist in crushing our enemy.</p>

<p>It is not customary, except in one clear case, for
a neutral Government to insist that a belligerent
should adopt, <i>in medias res</i>, its views of a question
which does not involve any issue of peace or war:
to press on him, <i>in medium bellum</i>, a modification
of his belligerent action which might cost him
the victory. The clear case of exception is when,
philosophy at fault, there are not two sides to
the question, but one only, and that testified to
by flagrant breaches of the laws of humanity and
war. Everything else is fair fighting; and for
a neutral Government, because its own commercial
interests are affected, to insist on the adoption
of its view of a debateable point, to persist that
it is not debateable, to take action, in itself a
violation of international law,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> savours of unneutral
service. In the absence of suggestion of anything
but perfect good faith, in the face of much
demonstrated care of the interests of its citizens,
the abandonment by a neutral Government of
the dispassionate attitude which neutrality requires
not merely heartens the enemy but must
result in rendering him material assistance.</p>

<p>The United States Government, by placing
England and Germany on the same plane of protest,—the
‘lawless conduct’ of the belligerents—has,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
as it seems to me, lost the true measure of national
right and wrong on which humanity must rest its
laws if civilisation is to continue. In redressing
wrongs the law has never placed injuries to life
and property on the same level. A neutral
Government whose citizens have suffered in life
by the action of one belligerent, in fortune, however
grievously, by the action of the other, must
yet be guided as to the manner of its protests
by the relative degree of the offences.</p>

<p>Now, assuming England’s high-sea policy to
be illegal, two things appear to me clear: First,
that we are entitled to claim from the United
States a consideration of the circumstances which
led to the commission of the offence of which we
are accused, in order to see whether, as Reprisals,
it was not justified. The Protest of the 2nd of April
expressly refuses this consideration; it proceeds
on the assumption that Reprisals can never be
resorted to against an enemy, if the interests of
a neutral trader are affected: Secondly, that,
quite apart from the Arbitration Treaty, we are
justified in insisting on a reference to arbitration
after the War as the complete present answer to the
charge, for this all-sufficient reason, that on calm
review it may appear that our action is warranted
by international law. There is no indication in the
last paragraph of the new Protest that this view is
acquiesced in by the United States.</p>

<p>Reduced, therefore, to its simplest expression,
the position taken up by the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
is this: Our trade is of greater importance
than your victory. Admitting the hypothesis to
the full that a neutral country has no interest
in the result of a war, is unconcerned which side
wins, yet I do not believe that this attitude finds
any warrant in the principles on which international
law is based. But there is another and
very practical reason in favour of my second
contention. Too strenuous a protest is apt to
make men look a little below the surface of mere
words, to turn their attention curiously to trade
statistics. They have been dexterously handled in
the British answers. A neutral Government is not
the best judge of its merchants’ claims; inevitably
it becomes their advocate, and in the tangle of
discussion is apt to identify itself with commercial
transactions which, it is common knowledge, often
need the closest investigation. The true position
of a neutral Government, the almost complete
severance from its protection of merchants who
deal, however indirectly, with a belligerent, demands,
I venture with great deference to assert,
an altogether different attitude from that taken
by the United States Government.</p>

<p>International law has of late been the subject
of much loose talk, by the German especially;
and some colour has been lent to his assertions
by the nature of the American Protests to Great
Britain. International law does not profess to
govern the conduct of belligerents between themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
but only the laws of war. Except in
so far as these have been incorporated in conventions,
except in so far as the principles of
humanity have been reduced into concrete words
and so have become laws binding the consenting
nations when they fight, it is not the province of
international law to mitigate the blows of war.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
A neutral Government is not concerned with the
methods of warfare adopted by a belligerent until
they ape the barbarian. Then, even in the absence
of convention, it is entitled to protest in the name
of our common humanity. Conventions to which
both belligerents and the neutral are parties
entitle it to support its protest by diplomatic
action. But, convention or no convention, more
strenuous action is justified by the application
of elementary legal principles when its citizens,
pursuing their normal avocations, are injured.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
International law, properly understood, governs
the relations of belligerents with neutrals. Its
sanctions are not belligerent action, nor any action
against the alleged offender, which may even indirectly
benefit the enemy. Arbitration after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
War, and compensation, are the only remedies
when neutral property has been injured. Then,
and only then, can the principles of international
law be calmly discussed; then, and only then, can
any new departure by a belligerent be tested by
a reference to fundamental principles. The reason
is obvious. International law is a progressive
science; it has not yet pronounced its last word
on the relations between belligerency and neutrality.
A neutral Government is not entitled to assume that
it alone is the judge of what that last word will be.</p>

<p>These fundamental principles have been lost
sight of in the Protests of the United States to
Great Britain. Yet there never was a case in
which calm discussion was more necessary, for
we have come to a point when the question is
definitely raised whether international law is to
stand still where the last war left it, or whether
its principles are sufficiently elastic to allow of
their adaptation to modern developments of the
machinery of war. I say deliberately that this
calm discussion must result in the completest
justification of the Order in Council; if it does not,
the doom of international law is certain.</p>

<p>But the discussion which has arisen round
the Order in Council has one peculiar feature.
It is, I suppose, one of the blessings resulting
from freedom of speech that our own people
should criticise the action of their Government,
even when the country is engaged in a conflict
which must be fought out to the bitter end. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
so much of the world as lies beyond the shadow
of the clouds of war, that little fragment of it
which is still capable of calm thinking, this curious
spectacle has been presented, that to the passionate
assertions of the Central Powers, to the dispassionate
threats of the United States, there
has been added the angry criticism of our own
people, in which the press and correspondents,
of high and low degree of learning, have joined
without remorse. I have looked in vain for one
defender of the faith.</p>

<p>Assuredly American dialectic needed no such
heartening; the insistence that the American
view of international law is alone worthy to
be received needed no such support as it has
had from our own people. It is true that
some of them have been inspired by the British
desire that, whate’er betide, England must fight
fair. But the end which the angry criticism
had in view, and professes to have achieved, was
not this at all; it was that the Government
should take other steps to accomplish what
had already been accomplished by the Order in
Council, should decline on a range of lower action,
and a narrower line of legal thought. The new
Protest, in paragraph 19, does not fail to make
the point. Whatever it may be worth, the distinguished
chemists, foremost among the critics,
are responsible for furnishing the United States
with the argument.</p>

<p>The demand for action, so strenuously expressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
during the Cotton-Contraband discussion, entirely
ignored what the Government had already
done. There may have been cause for criticism
as to the effectiveness of executive action. I
do not profess to know; but whether this were
so or not, it was not to be remedied, as it was
attempted to be remedied, by an attack on the
validity of the Order in Council. It was said
that many lawyers are agreed that it was invalid.
I have ventured to present the other side for
public consideration.</p>

<p>A system of law, though intermittently created
as occasion has arisen, must, if it is to be taken
as serious law, stand the test of an evolutionary
analysis. The doctrines of contraband and blockade
cannot stand for a moment if they are based
on no principle, if they go no further back than
the commentators have carried them.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I have
endeavoured to show that the principle on which
both are based is the same, and is to be found in
the Right of War: that both are the inevitable
consequences affecting neutral merchants who have
any relations with the enemy of the exercise of
legitimate belligerent action against him, and
that they originate in, and, though varying in the
intensity of its action, are both linked with sea-power
and the efficiency of its visible agent, the
Fleet. That German commerce should have
received its death-blow, that neutral merchants
should have suffered in consequence, are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
natural, the inevitable results of the command
of the sea which in fair fighting in times past
England has won for herself.</p>

<p>But there has been introduced into the controversy
an expression, the mere mention of
which seems to send men’s minds dancing with
unreason—the ‘Freedom of the Sea.’ Very
dexterously, the Germans have substituted for
it another expression, the ‘Equality of the Sea.’
In spite of the captivating simplicity of the words,
it is used with sinister intent, in the hope to redress
the inequality of the hostile Fleets.</p>

<p>If a Fleet is a legitimate weapon of offence and
defence for nations whose borders are on the sea,
then the fortune of one aspect of war between
them must rest with the superior Fleet, and when
war does come the imagined equality of the sea,
whether for belligerents or for neutrals who cross
the track of it, vanishes.</p>

<p>The ‘freedom of the sea’ is a cry for something
as inarticulate as the other things that the
wild waves are saying. It means no more, no
less, than does the freedom of the King’s highway,
which is subject to a multitude of other
rights often reducing it to nothing. The
ingenuous pacifist sees in it the fulfilment of the
promise that wars shall cease. Yet if that and
all the other fanciful ideas which have gathered
round it—the ‘neutralization of the sea,’ for
example—come to prevail, wars will indeed cease,
but in a way the pacifist least dreams of.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
Hidden in that imagined ‘freedom,’ and the
‘rules’ which have been suggested to ensure it,
lies the power of the Strong to make one final
war upon the Weak on land, and the end of it
the annihilation of the Small Nations; for it
means this, that when they are attacked they
must defend themselves without help in munitions
of war from neutral merchants across
the sea.</p>

<p>The ‘freedom of the sea’ is not even complete
in time of peace, for it may not be set up by those
who have violated the laws of the nations which
border its shores. But when war comes the
‘freedom of the sea’ must give way to the rights
of war; and no one dare <i>now</i> deny that to declare
war may be a sacred right, to decline the gage
of battle an infamy. The only freedom that
remains, and even this is curtailed by the right of
search, is that of neutral merchants to carry on
their trade with one another unmolested, so long
as it does not deliberately enmesh itself in the
lines and areas of battle. But it must never be
forgotten that the United States is not vindicating
the simple right of neutral nations to trade with
one another untrammelled by belligerent action.
It maintains, and all the struggles of its advocacy
are devoted to establishing this proposition, that
‘innocent shipments may be freely transported
to and from the United States through neutral
countries to belligerent territory.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Here, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
is the whole matter ‘bounded in a nut-shell.’
It is admitted that a belligerent may forcibly
prevent <i>all</i> goods going from a neutral directly
to the enemy: it is admitted that he may also
prevent certain specified goods (called ‘contraband
of war’) going from a neutral indirectly
(that is, through another neutral country) to the
enemy. The United States protests that international
law ends with these two propositions:
that there is no underlying principle linking the two
admissions, making them only two illustrations
of a larger fact: that there is a chasm between
them that can never be bridged, even though not
merely the conditions of war, but also the constitution
of armies have changed: that international
law must stand at the point it reached ten
years ago, and a belligerent stand passively by
while neutral merchants sustain the enemy with
the things which give him life to continue the
fight.</p>

<p>The mere statement of the dispute shows
that the calm of a High Tribunal of Arbitration
is the only atmosphere conducive to its just
discussion.</p>

<p>That right of war upon the sea, as well as
that pure right of neutral traders upon the sea,
the Mistress of the Seas must steadfastly maintain,
for she holds them in trust for the nations and
may not barter them away. Above all, she must
know her own mind as to what that right is.
She has spoken with full knowledge, and, as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
believe, rightly. It would be a grievous blow to
her prestige if she were now to abandon the
position she has taken up. I cannot imagine such
an abandonment to be even dreamed of.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The scheme of these articles is as follows.
In the first, published before the American Protest
of the 30th of March was received, I have dealt
with the principal points in the early American
Notes to Great Britain and Germany, and have
traced a process of evolution to which all the
principles of contraband and blockade, as we
used to know them, do in fact conform. In
the second, after combating Mr. Norman Angell’s
project for the neutralization of the sea, I have
shown how this process of evolution warrants, by
a legitimate process of development, the practice
laid down by the Order in Council. In the third,
I have applied these principles to the discussion
to which the Government yielded when it put
cotton on the list of contraband.</p>

<p>Two questions lie altogether outside the scope
of the articles. First, the policy which, prior
to the issue of the Order, refrained from making
cotton contraband. Secondly, the policy which
guides executive action in carrying out the Order.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
They deal simply with the Order as it stands,
not with the method of its enforcement.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have, for the greater stability of my edifice,
used the reinforced concrete of the logic and
arguments which Sir William Harcourt created
in the famous, but almost forgotten, ‘Letters of
Historicus,’ incorporating in the footnotes more
extended quotations from those Letters. In a
few instances I have added a paragraph to the
articles as they originally appeared, for the sake
of greater clearness.</p>

<p>I trust that the manner in which I have set
forth what I conceive to be the true law of the
dispute will give no offence to my friends in the
United States. I am sure it will not, for some
who took part in the Behring Sea Arbitration
are still among the Minority, and they will
remember that those discussions did not want
for strenuousness with Phelps of counsel for
the United States, and Charles Russell for
England.</p>

<p>The intellectual barometer stands at ‘Hazy’ on
the subject of neutrality, even in this country.
In Germany it has ceased to register anything
which even pretends to be intelligent. In the
United States there are what might aptly be
called cyclonic and anti-cyclonic disturbances.
If my view as to English knowledge of the subject
be questioned, I would ask my readers how often
they have of late met in the newspapers the phrase
‘duties of neutrals,’ and what answer they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
found to the inevitable query, ‘Which be they?’
Within the last few weeks I read a contribution
to <i>The Times</i> from ‘A Legal Correspondent,’
in which these duties were referred to in most
bewildering fashion. He said that there existed
special bonds between this country and the United
States; that both have stringent Foreign Enlistment
Acts; that both agree to what are known
as the ‘Three Rules’ of the Washington Treaty
as to the duties of neutrals, and that both had
promised to bring these Rules to the notice of
other States. This statement was painfully misleading;
the ‘Three Rules’ were agreed to as
the basis on which the Alabama arbitration was
to be decided, and related solely to the subject
known as ‘Foreign Enlistment.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But if by ‘duties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
of neutrals’ is meant, as I presume to be the case,
the duties of neutral Governments, they can be
summarised in one great negative—to do nothing,
except when they are called on to defend their
neutrality against the action of either belligerent,
<i>inter alia</i>, in the cases provided for by the
Hague Convention of 1907 relating to neutrality.
So far-reaching is this universal negative that it
includes non-interference with their merchants in
their dealings with belligerents.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> If, however, the
term refers to duties of neutral merchants, then
it is inapt and misleadingly inaccurate; for the
existence of any such general duty as to cease
trading, for which the Germans are so strenuously
contending, is wholly imaginary.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago another continent was riven
with war, and there was much talk of what a
neutral might do, and might not do; and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
appeared in <i>The Times</i> a series of letters signed
‘Historicus,’ in which, among other things, the elementary
principles of neutrality were very strenuously
and very lucidly set forth. Very strenuously,
for there was a certain M. Hautefeuille who had
filled the world—like the Dernburgs of to-day—with
much unsound doctrine. Now unsound doctrine
was a thing which stirred Mr. Vernon Harcourt
to the depths of his soul, and those only who
have heard him know what waves of wrath surged
up in his brain. He had the art of transferring
to paper the billowy language he was wont to
use; and as you read you hear the rotund sentences
rolling onwards to swamp the frail bark
of his adversary. But he had another art: of
clear thinking and lucid exposition. In the series
of Whewell Lectures which I attended at Cambridge
in the year of grace ——, of which I still
preserve my notes, he seemed to make plain the
whole mystery of Public International Law. New
times have produced new teachers of the old
heresies; and it is good to turn once more to the
pages of the ‘Letters of Historicus,’ for again
the neutral nations are invited to ‘upset the whole
fabric of international law which the reason of
jurists has designed and the usage of nations has
built up.’ To adapt his references<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to Burke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
and Canning to himself, ‘I would that we had yet
amongst us his multitudinous eloquence and his
poignant wit to do justice upon this presumptuous
sciolism’ of the German Foreign Office. The world,
indeed, seems still to need his teaching. From
what one hears in the market-place I gather that
there is a vague feeling in the air that our case is
not <i>quite</i> so good as we should like it to be; that
there is a mysterious crevice in our armour-joints
through which, if not the German, at least Uncle
Sam has pricked us. There is a nebulous ‘something’
about neutrality, especially about ‘neutral
duties,’ which seems to preclude accurate thinking;
and even the ‘Legal Correspondent’ does not
always pierce the haze. So the student, in memory
of an hour spent after lecture in his master’s
rooms in Neville’s Court, when kindly patient,
and so lucidly, he expounded to him the meaning
of a difficult decision, will endeavour to weave into
a continuous whole the threads of the doctrine
which he taught. It is not that people do not
know; only that they forget.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The neutral merchant is the centre round which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the principal doctrines of international law dealing
with neutrality have gathered. It seems strange
at first that in time of war the commercial rights
of a mere money-making civilian should invariably
form the subject of endless discussions; but this
civilian really holds a very important position in
the waging of war; it could not go on without
him. Each belligerent has need of him, and it is
essential to each to prevent the other from satisfying
that need. To block the enemy’s communications
with the neutral merchant is one of the surest
ways of ending the war. To this end many ingenious
things have been devised, and as many
equally ingenious to counteract them; and in this
the merchant’s fertile brain has materially assisted.
The problem is a complex one, for each belligerent
as a buyer must strive to keep him in a good humour,
but as a fighter must do all he can to thwart him.
As for the neutral merchant himself, he is calmly indifferent
to the merits of the fight; nothing pleases
him so much as to be ‘Jack of Both Sides.’ He
will take all he can get from one side and cry out
for more from the other. When the War is over
we may muse philosophically on some aspects of
the Protest which the United States Government
has addressed to Great Britain on behalf of its
merchants; for the present, with all its serious issues
hanging in the balance, the American Notes require
careful study, for they themselves raise an issue
as serious as any which the War has raised—whether
Great Britain has been true to the principles
she has so often preached, or whether the German
accusation, or the American suggestion, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
has violated them can be substantiated; whether,
when all is over, we shall be able to say proudly
that it has been War with Honour.</p>


<h3><i>The Use of Neutral Flags by Merchantmen</i></h3>

<p>Two Notes have been addressed to Great
Britain, and it will be convenient to refer at once
to the second Note, which deals with the use by
our merchantmen of neutral flags. The neutral
merchant is directly concerned with this custom of
the sea, for he may have cargo on board, and if
this means of deceiving the enemy’s warships
is declared to be illegal he runs the chance of
its being sent to the bottom.</p>

<p>The facts which gave rise to the Note are of
the simplest. On the 30th of January two German
submarines appeared off Liverpool, and, giving the
crews ten minutes to take to the boats, torpedoed
and sank some British merchant vessels. On
the 6th of February the <i>Lusitania</i>, coming up the
Irish Channel at the end of her voyage from New
York, hoisted the Stars and Stripes and came safely
to harbour. To these simple facts are to be added,
according to the German version, that the Admiralty
advised the master by wireless to hoist the American
flag; or had issued a secret order to merchant
ships in general to hoist a neutral flag in the
circumstances. Whether these facts are accurate
or not is absolutely immaterial; but the Germans
have based on them the charge of violation of
international law. It should be noted with surprised
wonder that the German Admiralty seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
to have forgotten that the <i>Emden</i> sailed into
Penang harbour flying the Japanese ensign, and
that this, added to her other disguises, enabled
her to accomplish her raid successfully.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
United States Government, having been appealed
to by Germany, addressed a Note to Great Britain,
to the great jubilation of her adversary; for she
had just planned the infamy of her new piracy,
and the smart of the thrashing administered to
herself was somewhat mitigated by the fact that
the other boy got a ‘wigging’ too. The position
of the United States is so delicate, her diplomatic
officers have achieved so much, her people have
done and said so many things that have gone
to our hearts, that it is impossible to be querulous
at the presentation of the Note; yet, when it is
analysed, it seems to go far beyond what was
necessary to the occasion, and it has enabled
Germany to confuse, in her usual clumsy fashion,
the <i>post</i> and the <i>propter</i> in the sequence of events.</p>

<p>The Government of the United States reserved
for future consideration the legality and propriety
of the deceptive use of the flag of a neutral Power
in any case for the purpose of avoiding capture;
but pointed out that the occasional use of the
flag of a neutral or of an enemy under stress of
immediate pursuit, and to deceive an approaching
enemy, was</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a very different thing from the explicit sanction by a
belligerent Government for its merchant ships generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
to fly the flag of a neutral Power within certain portions
of the high seas which, it is presumed, will be frequented
with hostile warships. A formal declaration of such
a policy for the general misuse of a neutral’s flag jeopardises
the vessels of a neutral visiting those waters
in a peculiar degree by raising the presumption that
they are of belligerent nationality, regardless of the flag
they may carry.</p>
</div>

<p>The Note declared that the United States
would view with anxious solicitude any such
general use of its flag; it would afford no protection
to British vessels, it would be a serious and constant
menace to the lives and vessels of American citizens,
and a measure of responsibility for their loss would
be imposed on the Government of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The reply of the British Government was
short and to the point. It dwelt on the fact that
the Merchant Shipping Act sanctions the use
of the British flag by foreign merchantmen in
time of war for the purpose of evading the enemy;
that instances are on record when United States
vessels availed themselves of this facility during
the American Civil War, and that, therefore, it
would be contrary to fair expectation if now,
when the conditions are reversed, the United
States and neutral nations were to grudge to
British ships liberty to take similar action. ‘The
British Government,’ it continued, ‘have no
intention of advising their merchant shipping to
use foreign flags as a general practice, or to resort
to them otherwise than for escaping capture or
destruction.’ Finally, the responsibility for the
loss of neutral vessels in such circumstances must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
fall on the nation which had deliberately disregarded
the obligations recognised by all civilised
nations in connexion with the seizure of merchant
ships.</p>

<p>It is clear that the American Note had special
regard to the future, and expressed no opinion as
to what had occurred in the case of the <i>Lusitania</i>.
Now she did not fly the American flag to escape
capture, but to escape the probability of being
unlawfully sunk by a German submarine; for,
in view of what had already happened off Liverpool,
it is more than probable that a submarine
was in lurking for her; to judge from the German
irritation at her escape, it is practically certain.
What she did, therefore, was in self-defence, and
even unlawful things become lawful when they
are done to escape extreme danger. The Note
refers to the use of a neutral flag to escape capture,
the reply justifies it, and the Merchant Shipping
Act sanctions it. But, seeing that capture by
the enemy is equivalent to destruction, quite
apart from the methods of the new piracy, there
can be no doubt that the principle of self-defence
covers this case also. Self-defence is a natural
law which has been embodied in all legal systems,
and Nature has sanctioned it as a special plea.
‘Protective coloration’ is the device by which
she defends the weak from the unscrupulous
strong; it is ‘mimesis,’ a mimetic change, which
Nature not only approves in the case of actually
hunted animals, but also and mainly devises for
those which are likely to be hunted. So the analogy
is complete, and the change of her ‘colours’ by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the <i>Lusitania</i> to escape the lurking danger of
the submarine stands justified by both natural
and human law. I prefer this explanation to
the theory of the <i>ruse de guerre</i>.</p>

<p>By a <i>ruse de guerre</i>, or stratagem of war, I
understand the adoption of some means of deceiving
the enemy in war, some device out of the ordinary
course of fighting. The old adage that ‘all is fair
in love and war’ is not strictly true, for some
stratagems are not unjustifiable in war, and some
are. The <i>Emden</i>, when she rigged up a fourth
funnel, so making believe she was some other
ship, resorted to a legitimate stratagem which
had unfortunate results for our Allies’ ships in
Penang harbour. The German soldiers who put
on our dead men’s uniforms also resort to a stratagem;
but we are fastidious in our methods of
fighting, and do not admit that this is ‘playing
the game’ of war. But, whether legitimate or
illegitimate, these are <i>ruses de guerre</i>; and the
term is hardly applicable to a stratagem adopted
by a non-combatant to avoid an unlawful trap
set by the enemy for his destruction.</p>


<h3><i>The First American Note to Great Britain</i></h3>

<p>I pass now to the more serious matter of the
Note of friendly protest of the 28th of December,
which was an amplification of one already presented
on the 7th of November. It opens with
the declaration that the present condition of
the trade of the United States, resulting from
frequent seizures and detentions of cargoes destined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
to neutral European ports, has become so serious
as to require a candid statement of the view of
the United States Government that the British
policy is an infringement of the rights of its
citizens, and denies to neutral commerce the
freedom to which it is entitled by the law of
nations. An improvement had been confidently
awaited on account of the statement of the Foreign
Office that the British Government ‘were satisfied
with guarantees offered by the Norwegian,
Swedish, and Danish Governments as to the
non-exportation of contraband goods when consigned
to named persons in the territories of
those Governments.’ But although nearly five
months had passed since the War began, it was
a matter of deep regret to find that the British
Government</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>have not materially changed their policy and do not
treat less injuriously ships and cargoes passing between
neutral ports in the peaceful pursuit of lawful commerce
which belligerents should protect rather than interrupt.
The greater freedom from detention and seizure which
was confidently expected to result from consigning shipments
to definite consignees rather than ‘to order’ is
still awaited.</p>
</div>

<p>The general principle is then laid down that,
‘seeing that peace, and not war, is the normal
relation between nations,’</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>the commerce between countries which are not belligerents
should not be interfered with by those at war
unless such interference is manifestly an imperative
necessity to protect their national safety, and then only
to the extent that it is a necessity.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>But articles on the list of absolute contraband
consigned to neutral countries from America have
been seized and detained ‘on the ground that the
countries to which they were destined have not
prohibited the exportation of such articles.’ Italy
had prohibited the export of copper, and shipments
to Italian consignees or ‘to order’ cannot
be exported or transhipped; copper can only
pass through that country if it is in transit to
another country. Yet the British Foreign Office
had ‘declined to affirm that copper shipments to
Italy will not be molested on the high seas.’</p>

<p>In the case of conditional contraband there is
a presumption of innocent use when it is destined
to neutral territory; yet the British authorities
had seized and detained cargoes without</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>being in possession of facts which warranted a reasonable
belief that the shipments had in reality a belligerent
destination as that term is used in international law.
Mere suspicion is not evidence, and doubts should be
resolved in favour of neutral commerce, not against it.</p>
</div>

<p>Cargoes had, in fact, been seized ‘because of a belief
that, though not originally so intended by the
shippers, they will ultimately reach’ the enemy.
A consignment of conditional contraband shipped
to a neutral port does not raise a presumption of
enemy destination; such a presumption is directly
opposed to Lord Salisbury’s statement, made
during the South African war, as to foodstuffs
(equally applicable to all conditional contraband)
which, ‘though having a hostile destination, can
be considered as contraband only if they are
for the enemy forces. It is not sufficient that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
they are capable of being so used. It must be
shown that was in fact their destination at the
time of their seizure.’ As to concealed contraband,
it is conceded that there is a right to detain
neutral ships when there is sufficient evidence
to justify belief that contraband articles are in
their cargoes; but the ships cannot be taken
into port and there detained ‘for the purpose
of searching generally for contraband, or upon
presumptions created by special municipal enactment
which are clearly at variance with international
law and practice.’ Many of the industries
of the United States are suffering ‘because their
products are denied long-established markets in
European countries which, though neutral, are
contiguous to the nations at war.’ The effect
on trade is not entirely cured by reimbursements
for damages suffered when an enemy destination
has not been established; ‘the injury is to
American commerce as a whole through the
hazard of the enterprise and the repeated diversion
of goods from established markets.’</p>

<p>Resolved into its simplest expression, the complaint
is a criticism of the way in which the doctrine
of ‘continuous voyages’ has been applied
by the British Government; but there is also a
veiled criticism of the doctrine itself; and, by way
of further complaint, it is pointed out that the
embargoes which have been declared in certain
countries have proved insufficient to prevent the
doctrine being applied. As to the principle asserted
that doubts are to be resolved in favour of neutral
commerce, it has no warrant in common sense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
for it puts a premium on the neutral merchant’s
ingenuity, an ingenuity which has itself given
rise to the doctrine of ‘continuous voyages.’
Seeing that commerce is in the balance against a
nation’s existence, the doubt must obviously be
resolved in favour of the more important consideration.
The Note is also open to the general
criticism that it is based on the position of the
vendor and ignores the purchaser. But the true
criterion of destination must often be found in
the intentions of the neutral purchaser of which
the neutral vendor may be ignorant.</p>

<p>An interim reply was sent by the British Government
on the 7th of January. It begins with a
cordial concurrence in the general principle that a
belligerent should not interfere with trade between
neutrals unless such interference is necessary to
protect the belligerent’s national safety, and then
only to the extent to which this is necessary;
with this qualification, however, that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>we shall endeavour to keep our action within the limits
of this principle, on the understanding that it admits
our right to interfere when such interference is, not with
<i>bona-fide</i> trade between the United States and another
neutral country, but with trade in contraband destined
for the enemy’s country, and we are ready, whenever
our action may unintentionally exceed this principle to
make redress.</p>
</div>

<p>The figures showing the export of copper from
the United States in 1913 and 1914 to Italy,
Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland (‘countries
which, though neutral, are contiguous to the
nations at war’) are then compared, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
astonishing increases duly noted. The conclusion
is very clear.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With such figures the presumption is very strong that
the bulk of the copper consigned to these countries has
recently been intended not for their own use, but for
that of a belligerent who cannot import it direct.</p>
</div>

<p>Granted the soundness of the American proposition,
the British case falls within it; the
‘imperative necessity for the safety of the country’
has arisen. As to concealed contraband the case
is even clearer. Cotton is not on the list of contraband.
But information has reached the Government
that ‘precisely because we have declared our
intention of not interfering with cotton, ships
carrying cotton will be specially selected to carry
concealed contraband; and we have been warned
that copper will be concealed in bales of cotton.’
For this there is only one remedy: the cargo
must be examined and the bales weighed; further,
this cannot be done at sea, therefore the ship must
be brought into port. The general justification
of the action of the British Government is couched
in these weighty words, which go to the foundations
of the whole law of contraband and the
right of search: ‘We are confronted with the
growing danger that neutral countries contiguous
to the enemy will become, on a scale hitherto
unprecedented, a base of supplies for the armed
forces of our enemies and for materials for manufacturing
armament.... We endeavour, in the
interest of our own national safety, to prevent
this danger by intercepting goods really destined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
for the enemy, without interfering with those
which are <i>bona-fide</i> neutral.’</p>

<p>The extraordinary procedure adopted by the
United States Government of <i>prohibiting</i> the
publication of manifests within thirty days after
the departure of vessels from American ports,
obviously increased the difficulties of the British
Government in exercising its right of search
even in the most ordinary circumstances. If I
am right in my view that the duty of neutrals
is to do nothing, for the simple reason that any
action may be of assistance to one of the
belligerents, it must be confessed that this order
comes perilously near to a breach of neutrality.</p>

<p>The reply deals also with the seizure of foodstuffs,
but it is unnecessary, in view of subsequent
action taken in regard to them, to refer to this
part of the document. It also mentions a somewhat
unusual complaint, not included in the
American Note, of our own embargo on rubber,
imposed in consequence of a new trade in exporting
rubber from the United States in suspiciously
large quantities to neutral countries, which had
sprung up since the war. The complaint is not
very intelligible, because it looks at embargo from
the wrong point of view. The right point of view
is explained later in this article.</p>

<p>The full reply of the British Government was
dated the 10th of February. It contained the
very important declaration that our action against
neutral vessels ‘has been limited to vessels on
their way to enemy ports or ports in neutral
countries adjacent to the theatre of war, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
it is only through such ports that the enemy
introduces the supplies which he requires for
carrying on the war.’ In other words, the importance
of the doctrine of ‘continuous voyages’ at
the present time is emphasised; and its necessity
is demonstrated by a further review of trade
statistics, which led to the inevitable conclusions
‘that not only has the trade of the United States
with the neutral countries in Europe been maintained
as compared with previous years, but also
that a substantial part of this trade was, in fact,
trade intended for the enemy countries going
through neutral ports by routes to which it was
previously unaccustomed.’</p>

<p>But even more important is the opinion deliberately
expressed that international law, like every
other judge-made law, is a live body of principles
which can and must keep abreast of the times.
Its rules are not arbitrarily devised as occasions
arise, but are based on principles which have
developed with the progress of the world. Any
apparent changes in the law which Great Britain
has introduced are not arbitrary inventions which
have in view merely the crushing of Germany,
but are justified by well-known principles applied
to new conditions. The process of adaptation
is no new one. The advent of steam-power had
a notable influence on the development of the
law, for the facilities introduced by steamers
and railways, while they simplified the task of the
neutral merchant in contraband, had enormously
magnified the difficulties of the belligerent.</p>

<p>The question in issue can be stated in almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
primitive fashion. Are the rules which governed
the rights of belligerents when there were no
railways, to govern them when the transit of
contraband over the frontier of a neutral and a
belligerent State has been made so easy? The
answer is not an absolute negative; it is that
the old principles are living principles and are
capable of extension to meet the new occasions.</p>

<p>But to explain the reasons for a step which
has already been taken and to find sound reasons
for a step which has to be taken are two different
things. The first requires reasoning power, the
second imagination; and I find this in the position
boldly taken up and courageously insisted on, that
the growth in size of ocean liners has rendered
a further amplification of the old rules necessary.
They must be brought into port for examination.</p>

<p>The American loves the cut and thrust of argument,
and must at once have acknowledged that
the reference to the fact that the doctrine of
‘continuous voyages’ originated with the Judges
of the United States was not a <i>tu quoque</i>, but
a brilliant illustration of the principle of development
of the law. It is abundantly clear from
every paragraph of this remarkable reply that
this doctrine has become the one principle worth
fighting for now, for our national safety depends
on it. And the American will appreciate the
delicacy of the compliment which can find no
stronger arguments than those used by the Judges
of the United States Prize Courts when they
established it.</p>

<p>The earlier American Note of the 7th of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
November had contended that ‘the belligerent
right of visit and search requires that the search
should be made on the high seas at the time of the
visit, and that the conclusion of the search should
rest upon the evidence found on the ship under
investigation, and not upon circumstances ascertained
from external sources.’ But the major
premiss is that the actual destination of the vessel
to the neutral port may be merely a cloak for
the real destination of the cargo to the enemy;
and the citation from the judgment in the case
of the <i>Bermuda</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is a complete answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The final destination of the cargo in this particular
voyage was left so skilfully open ... that it was not
quite easy to prove, with that certainty which American
Courts require, the intention, which it seemed plain
must have really existed. Thus to prove it required
that truth should be collated from a variety of sources,
darkened and disguised; from others opened as the cause
advanced, and by accident only; from coincidences undesigned,
and facts that were circumstantial. Collocations
and comparisons, in short, brought largely their collective
force in aid of evidence that was more direct.</p>
</div>

<p>To introduce the rigid rules of evidence necessary
to a common-law action in a question which is not
a lawsuit at all, but an inquiry, would obviously
cripple the effectiveness of the doctrine of ‘continuous
voyages’; the occasions with which that
doctrine deals have by force of circumstances
become the most important source of supply of
those commodities which a belligerent must at
all hazards prevent his enemy obtaining. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
if we go back to the root-principle, that the whole
law and every part of it depend on the right of
self-defence, no stronger argument is necessary
to justify the principle laid down in this case,
nor for the provisions of the Order in Council of
the 29th of October, which throw the burden of
proof of his innocence on the neutral owner of
contraband.</p>


<h3><i>The First American Note to Germany</i></h3>

<p>I now come to the Note to Germany of the 12th
of February, delivered in consequence of the
notification of her under-sea policy, and for which
‘Warning’ is the only appropriate term. The
statement of the principles set at defiance is introduced
by the satirical formula ‘It is unnecessary
to remind,’ the whole object of the Note being to
remind the German Government that the interference
with the freedom of the sea is limited to
search and blockade, and that in the absence of
effective blockade the belligerent nationality or
contraband character of the cargo must be determined
before a vessel may be destroyed.</p>

<p>To this Note came the German reply which
set forth England’s iniquities and violations of
international law, which were in startling contrast
to the scrupulous observance of ‘valid international
rules regarding naval warfare’ by Germany.
There is a complacent reference to the
American Note to Great Britain of the 28th of
December, which sets out the details of our
iniquities ‘sufficiently, though not exhaustively’;
but the main interest of the document is its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
method of dealing with the duties of neutral States
towards Germany.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Neutrals have been unable to prevent the interruption
of their commerce with Germany, which is contrary to
international laws.</p>

<p>Germany is as good as cut off from her overseas
supply by the silent or protesting toleration of neutrals
not only in regard to such goods as are absolute contraband,
but also in regard to such as, according to the
acknowledged law before the war, are only conditional
contraband or not contraband at all. Great Britain,
on the other hand, is, with the toleration of neutral Governments,
not only supplied with such goods as are not
contraband or only conditional contraband, but with goods
which are regarded by Great Britain, if sent to Germany,
as absolute contraband—namely, provisions, industrial
raw material, etc.—and even with goods which have
always indubitably been regarded as absolute contraband.</p>
</div>

<p>There follows a reference ‘with greatest emphasis’
to the enormous traffic in arms which is being
‘carried on between American firms and Germany’s
enemies’; after which come two sentences most
typical of German occultness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Germany fully comprehends that the practice of right
and toleration of wrong on the part of neutrals are matters
absolutely at the discretion of neutrals and involve no
formal violation of neutrality.... If it is the formal
right of neutrals to take no steps to protect their legitimate
trade with Germany, and even to allow themselves
to be influenced in the direction of conscious wilful restriction
of their trade, on the other hand, they have a
perfect right, which they unfortunately do not exercise,
to cease contraband trade, especially in arms, with
Germany’s enemies.</p>
</div>

<p>The involutions of these astonishing sentences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
are worthy of the White Queen at her best, and it
is quite a difficult exercise to arrive at their meaning.
So far as I have been able to get at it, it is something
like this:—Trade is free; you neutral merchants
have a right to trade with Germany as with
Great Britain; why don’t you? That would be the
‘practice of right.’ Germany has as much right
to have you trade with her as Great Britain has;
why do you deny her that right? You allow
yourselves rather ‘to be influenced in the direction
of conscious wilful restriction’ (in other words, you
submit to having your cargoes seized by Great
Britain). Of course you have the right to take
no steps to protect your legitimate trade with
Germany, and you take none (in other words,
you refuse to resist the seizures of your cargoes
by force); that is ‘the toleration of wrong.’ And
so you cease to trade with Germany. But you
have also a perfect right to cease trading in contraband
(especially in arms) with Great Britain.
Why don’t you? In her case you do not allow
yourselves ‘to be influenced in the direction of
conscious wilful restriction.’ To all of which the
neutral merchants reply: When you begin to make
an appreciable attack upon our trade with Great
Britain and seize our cargoes, then you may be
sure that we shall be influenced ‘in the direction
of conscious wilful restriction’ of that trade also.
But until that time arrives, we regret that we
cannot take the risk of having to run the gauntlet
of the British Fleet. In all seriousness these
mysterious sentences mean no more than that
Germany has lost such influence upon the sea as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
she ever had, and the neutral merchant has
made a note of it and governs himself accordingly.
Therefore the traffic in arms, in spite of her
pathetic protests, must go on.</p>


<h3><i>THE EVOLUTION OF THE DOCTRINES OF CONTRABAND
OF WAR AND BLOCKADE</i></h3>

<p>So much for the Notes and the Answers, and
I pass to the realm of international law.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In a
recent debate in Parliament a noble Lord suggested
that, in view of German disregard of it, we need
not be ‘too fastidious’ in our application of
its principles.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Even at the best of times, before
war shook things to their foundations, the layman
was disposed to look on it as a thing of shreds
and patches. I am sure he would be surprised
to hear that the principles are coherent, and that
there is a thread of simple common-sense running
through all the various doctrines. The fate of
the Empire depends on the action which the
Government takes on these important questions, its
honour on this action being strictly in accordance
with the law which the nations have agreed to.
I make no apology, therefore, for treading once
more the well-beaten track, for I take it that
it is the business of the good citizen to know
what he is talking about, and in order to help him
I shall begin at the very beginning. And the
beginning is War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>


<h3><i>The Meaning of Neutrality</i></h3>

<p>At the outbreak of war the nations are divided
into two classes: those that are fighting and those
that are not. To give them their scientific names,
they are belligerents and neutrals. With the laws
of war I do not concern myself, but only with
those principles by which neutrals are supposed
to govern themselves in order to avoid being
swept into the vortex.</p>

<p>The only means by which this most desirable
object can be achieved is by steadfastly bearing
in mind the natural consequence of meddling
in other people’s frays. It gives rise to the very
simple maxim ‘He who joins himself to my enemy
makes himself my enemy and may be treated
as such.’ For the world’s peace the doctrine
‘He that is not with me is against me’ finds no
place in the maxims of nations. Now there is
a root-principle of neutrality, and if it is once
let go all the subordinate principles will fly off
and become isolated bodies careering through
intellectual space, and doing an incalculable amount
of damage. This principle is, that neutrality is a
state appertaining to the Governments of the non-belligerent
countries, and to the Governments alone.
Azuni says<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that ‘the state of neutrality is not,
nor can be, a new state, but a continuation of a
former one, by the Sovereign who has no wish to
change it.’ But neutrality has nothing whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to do with the individual, and all the puzzles
which confuse the public mind arise from the
fact that the word ‘neutral’ is applied indiscriminately
to Governments and to individuals.
The importance of appreciating this is manifest,
for if it is unsound the German case, in which
the contrary doctrine appears and reappears over
and over again, is right; if it is sound that case
tumbles to pieces. It is the persistence with
which the German Foreign Office has dragged
the opposite contention in by the heels on every
possible occasion which makes it so necessary to
insist on the recognition of this principle. The
burden of its reply to the United States, the condition
on which Germany will abandon its evil
under-water practices, is that this principle should
be given up, and the neutral trade in arms with
its enemies declared illegal. If it could be
thought for a moment that the United States was
likely to be beguiled into abandoning it, then the
peace of the world would indeed be in jeopardy.
But, unfortunately for the Germans, the Americans
know full well what the principle means, and the
place it holds in the international system, for
them to give even the slightest hint that this is
possible.</p>

<p>What, then, does neutrality mean? That the
Government of a non-belligerent State must do
nothing to assist either belligerent, by providing
him with arms, or ships, or men, or money. It is
not difficult to understand why neutrality is not
applicable to the individuals of the non-belligerent
States. Nations subsist by international commerce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and there is no reason why, because two of
them go to war, all their trade with the others
should be declared illegal.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Therefore we get at
once to this axiom, that war does not affect neutral
trade with either belligerent, but the merchants in
neutral countries are entitled to carry on business
with them. And so the neutral merchant makes
his first appearance on the scene.</p>

<h3><i>Contraband of War</i></h3>

<p>But to adopt the language of the day, <i>Krieg ist
Krieg</i>; and if the neutral merchant has rights
so also have the belligerents, and the doctrine
of contraband of war gives expression to them,
though few doctrines have been so loosely put
into words. I think I am fairly stating the
prevalent and mistaken opinion when I put it
thus: that it is a breach of neutrality to trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
in contraband, and that it is the duty of a neutral
State to prevent its subjects from so trading.
The Germans, in insisting on this popular idea, are
juggling with the word ‘neutrality,’ and they do
so in a way which is almost pathetic; yet their
version of what they are pleased to call ‘true
neutrality’ is so near to plausibleness that I must
be at pains to elaborate the real principle. A belligerent
has a perfect right to apply the maxim
‘Who helps my enemy becomes my enemy’ to
the neutral merchant. But seeing that he is an
unarmed civilian he cannot be made to fight.
The remedy against him is therefore confiscation of
his goods. The special way in which the merchant
can help the enemy is by supplying him with
munitions of war and other means of carrying
on the fight. In order that there may be no
mistake a more particular list of things which help
the enemy is made out, called ‘Contraband of
War.’ Now the belligerent has no right, much less
any power, to prevent the merchant from selling
these things to his enemy; but he gives him fair
warning that if he sends them by sea cruisers will
be on the look-out for his vessels, and they will
be detained and searched and the contraband
cargo seized. If the merchant turns to his Government
and invokes its protection, talking about
the ‘freedom of the sea’ and the ‘common highway
of the nations,’ he will get for only answer,
‘The threat is justified and I cannot help you.
You are assisting the enemy and must take your
chance. I cannot prevent you taking that chance,
nor can I order you to forbear, for then I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
be interfering in favour of the other belligerent,
and that would be a breach of neutrality on my
part. All I can do for you is to see that you get
fair play if you are caught, and proper damages
if you are innocent.’ So now we get to the law
in its first shape: the neutral merchant is free to
carry on his trade with either or both belligerents
to any extent, in arms or in anything else; but
if he trades in contraband of war he takes the risk
of losing his cargo. The justification for the rule
can be put in simplest language. The belligerent
has obviously no right, merely because he is at
war, to order neutral merchants not to carry contraband
to the enemy, nor even to expect that
they will not. Neither can he insist that the
neutral merchant’s Government should intervene on
his behalf, and so commit a breach of neutrality
towards the other belligerent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Certain subsidiary questions arise at this point.
First, the familiar distinction between absolute
and conditional contraband. This follows in direct
sequence from what has already been said. The
belligerent is not fighting the civil population,
but only the enemy Government and its forces.
This compels him to interfere with neutral trade
in everything that enables that Government to
maintain its forces. But how to draw the line
between things destined for the civil population
and those destined for the forces, for things
destined for the civilian may be serviceable to
those forces, and may, in fact, be used by them.</p>

<p>The broad principle governing conditional contraband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
was stated by Lord Salisbury in the
<i>dictum</i> as to foodstuffs already referred to.</p>

<p>This principle was adhered to by us during the
early months of the War, and was expressly
referred to as having guided our action in Sir
Edward Grey’s interim reply, of the 7th of January,
to the American Note. But the War has revolutionised
many ideas, and among them those which
had led to the adoption of this principle by Great
Britain in the face of the opposing contentions of
other countries in the past, notably France and
Germany. In his final reply to the Note, sent
on the 10th of February, Sir Edward Grey frankly
stated that ‘in the absence of some certainty that
the rule would be respected by both parties to
this conflict, we feel great doubt whether it would
be regarded as an established principle of international
law.’ Further, he pointed out certain
new features in the circumstances in which the
War was being waged which tended to show that
an adherence to the old principle would be an
unjustifiable restriction on our power of striking
the enemy—(<i>i</i>) the existence of an elaborate
machinery for the supply of foodstuffs for the use
of the German army from overseas; (<i>ii</i>) the
practical disappearance of the distinction between
the civil population and the armed forces of
Germany; (<i>iii</i>) the power taken by the German
Government to requisition food for the use of
the army, which rendered it probable that goods
imported for civil use would be consumed by the
army if military exigencies required it.</p>

<p>I confess that there are many considerations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
which challenge the logic of the distinction between
absolute and conditional contraband, and give it
more the character of a humanitarian concession.
It introduces a new bone of contention between
belligerents and neutral traders, and it opens
up the grave danger of concealed contraband in
cargoes which are themselves innocent: the concealment
of copper, for example, in bales of cotton.
In view of the more rigorous rule of blockade
where the distinction disappears, it seems more
in the nature of a preliminary measure in the
process of throttling the enemy; the first turn
of the screw, and a suggestion of sterner measures
which are in store.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is important to note that the determination
of what is contraband, what absolute and what
conditional, is left to each belligerent. Seeing
that no law is possible on the subject, that
agreement has got no further than the unratified
Declaration of London,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and that it could not be
for the enemy to decide, there is no one but the
belligerent left. But it rests on a better reason.
Each belligerent is master of his own fray; he
can direct the attack at his own discretion, and
can strike his blows where he pleases; and if
we bear in mind what he <i>could</i> do, the declaration
that some things shall only be contraband if they
are destined for the enemy’s forces is clearly a
reservation of strength rather than an expenditure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of force. There is no rule which imposes half-measures
on any belligerent; he may exert all
his strength and destroy or seize all his enemy’s
property if he is able; the principle of blockade
expressly provides for it; the only thing that is
required of him is that, until he proceeds to extremes,
he must be careful how he interferes with
neutral property.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Another point requires explanation. Of course
all enemy ships upon the seas are lawful prize.
But it strikes one at once that here is a departure
from the principle that you do not make war upon
the civil population, for merchant ships are civilian
property. The neutral merchant has, however,
been looked after, for the Declaration of Paris has
proclaimed that ‘neutral goods, with the exception
of contraband of war, are not liable to capture
under enemy’s flag.’ But in the converse case,
it would not seem reasonable that enemy property
in neutral ships should escape capture. The
Declaration of Paris, however, steps in with the
arbitrary rule that ‘the neutral flag covers enemy’s
goods, with the exception of contraband of war.’
It cannot be said that this rule has done much to
safeguard the ‘freedom of the sea’ for neutral
vessels, for there is no doubt that guns consigned
to Germany discovered on an American ship on a
voyage from Galveston to Pernambuco would
be lawfully seized; and as the guns may be seized
the vessel may be detained and searched. But
practical considerations work in favour of the
neutral merchant. Not all the hosts of the Allied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Fleets would be sufficient for the stupendous
work which would be involved in putting this
right into practice; therefore good sense has
decreed that the destination of a ship to an enemy
port shall be adopted as the practical working
factor in its application, at least in the case of
conditional contraband. But this has engendered
the idea, which certainly is no part of the rule
in its naked simplicity, that neutral ships sailing
to neutral ports can carry enemy cargoes of contraband
with impunity. Enemy destination is
supposed alone to afford a presumption that there
is contraband for the enemy on board; but if
there were any doubt that the idea is erroneous,
the words ‘whatever be their destination,’ in a
judgment of Lord Stowell’s, to which I shall
presently refer, must dispel it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have talked of the belligerent right of seizure.
But civilised nations, recognising that in the most
elementary statement of the case not all neutral
cargoes even with an enemy destination are liable
to seizure, have realised the necessity of establishing
a tribunal by which this question of liability
and consequent confiscation can be decided. With
the right of some cargoes to escape there came
into being at once the duty of withdrawing the
decision from the summary process which the
sailor would inevitably adopt. The question of
liability might be a complicated one of fact: law
might be involved: a Court was essential. But
as to its constitution there were only three
alternatives: enemy judges, obviously impossible;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
neutral judges, or an international Court, not very
practicable; there remained nothing but judges
of the belligerent country. Hence the anomaly
of the Prize Court sitting in the seizing country’s
territory, presided over by judges of that country.
An anomaly, because it is contrary to the elementary
rule that no man shall be a judge in his own cause;
yet the judgment of a Prize Court is a judgment
<i>in rem</i>; it passes property, and is accepted as
binding against all the world by the Courts of all
other countries. There have been in the past
complaints of the decisions; sometimes they have
been followed by diplomatic representations. But
in these times when—I imagine for the first time
in history—a civilised Government has been deliberately
charged with having recourse to lying,
it surely is a bright spot in the international
horizon to think that the system of Prize Courts
has produced judges who, as the world has recognised,
have been among the greatest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But the detention of neutral ships at sea,
and the seizure of the contraband that they carry
to the enemy, can be put much higher than a
mere belligerent right; nor does it spring solely
from the vindictive principle that the neutral
aiding the enemy becomes an enemy; it is based
on the supreme right of self-defence. It is the
inevitable counterpoise to the right of the neutral
merchant to continue trading, even in contraband,
in spite of war. The importance of this trading right
to the neutral merchant is the measure of the importance
of this defensive right to the belligerent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>The right of the neutral merchant was put on
the large commercial ground by Mr. Huskisson:
‘Of what use would be our skill in building ships,
manufacturing arms, and preparing instruments
of war, if equally to sell them to all belligerents
were a breach of neutrality?’<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But it can be
put on a still larger ground. Without it the
small nations would go to the wall. If there
were such a doctrine as Germany now contends
for, a great country with unlimited resources
could speedily annihilate all the weak nations
one after the other. There is no such doctrine
as that when war is declared the warring nations
are to fight it out with their own resources only.
It is not the duty of neutral merchants to keep
the ring and let the best man win. Sentiment
does not come into the question. The neutral merchant
may serve that side which he earnestly
desires should win; but the other belligerent has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the extreme penalty of confiscation in his hands,
and sentiment must inevitably fade into the background.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the whole matter is that
the two great war doctrines are, the right of the
neutral merchant to trade in contraband, and the
right of the belligerent nations to seize his cargoes.
Combined, they make the simple principle that
the neutral merchant may supply contraband to
either side subject only to the risk of seizure by the
other. ‘The right of the neutral to transport,’
says Kent, ‘and of the hostile Power to seize, are
conflicting rights, and neither party can charge
the other with a criminal act.’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<h3><i>The Right and the Duty of Search</i></h3>

<p>But the principle of seizure is still in a very
crude state; and seeing that all cargoes destined
for the enemy are not liable to seizure, and that
for practical reasons it is neither possible nor
advisable to bring in every cargo for adjudication
in the Prize Courts, a supplementary right has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
been devised, known as the ‘right of search.’ It is
the first step in the seizure, and, on the one hand,
affords the belligerent an opportunity of letting non-contraband
cargo go free; on the other hand, it
gives the owner of the cargo an immediate opportunity
of proving its innocent character. The right
of search is often stated as an independent right,
but it is in reality secondary to the right of seizure,
and references to it obviously apply equally to
the right of seizure. As to its unlimited nature
I need do no more than quote the well-known
words of Lord Stowell in the case of the Swedish
convoy.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is incontrovertible</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>that the right of visiting and searching merchant ships
upon the high seas, whatever be the ships, whatever be
the cargoes, whatever be their destination, is an incontestable
right of the lawfully commissioned cruisers of
a belligerent nation.... This right is so clear in principle
that no man can deny it who admits the legality
of maritime capture, because if you are not at liberty to
ascertain by sufficient inquiry whether there is property
that can be captured, it is impossible to capture.</p>
</div>

<p>On this another rule has been grafted which
is suggested by the enunciation of the law as to
the right of search. That right <i>must</i> be exercised
for the very same reason that the right has been
allowed, for otherwise you do not know whether
you have the right to seize. From the <i>right
of search</i> has therefore developed the <i>duty to
search</i>; and it is the omission to recognise this
duty that has plunged the German Admiralty
into its piratical career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>


<h3><i>The Doctrine of Continuous Voyages</i></h3>

<p>But the heart of the neutral merchant is
desperately ingenious, especially when his country
is contiguous to the theatre of war, and no sooner
had he obtained the inch to which practical considerations
made him appear to be entitled than
he developed it into an ell of his own imagining.
He argued thus: A neutral vessel bound to an
enemy port is liable to detention, because the
presumption is that she has cargo for the enemy,
and that her cargo is probably contraband; the
presumption also is that cargoes on board a vessel
bound for a neutral port are not destined for the
enemy, even though they may be contraband;
nothing easier than to bring them across the sea
in a neutral vessel with a neutral destination; all
that remains to be done is to pass them on to
the belligerent, either transhipping them into
another vessel and sending it down the coast, out of
the way of the attentions of the enemy’s cruisers,
or better still, if the neutral and belligerent countries
are contiguous, by rail across the border. And
the best of the plan is that the shipper on the other
side of the water, say some innocent merchant in
copper in the United States, need know nothing
about it, so that if by chance the cargo does get
seized he will do all the shouting.</p>

<p>With this problem, devised in some such human
fashion, the United States was faced during the
Civil War, and the Judges settled it in characteristic
and logical manner. They discovered the
doctrine of ‘continuous voyages.’ It is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
more than the simple application of elementary
principles, and is arrived at by the elimination
of the presumption of innocence which the voyage
to the neutral port raised. All presumptions
may be rebutted, and this one manifestly. ‘Be
the destination what it may,’ the right of search
existed; the presumption had only been allowed
to grow because it was convenient. If goods
destined for the enemy reached him by way of a
neutral port, that port was only an intermediate
destination; the ultimate consignee was the
enemy, and there was a continuous voyage to
him from the port of shipment. Therefore the
seizure, and therefore the search, were justified,
and could not be denied merely because ‘the
final destination of the cargo was left so skilfully
open.’</p>

<p>But the neutral merchant’s wits are sharpened
by much profit in prospect; he is no simpleton,
and a consignment of, let us say, copper from
the United States is not likely to be addressed
‘Herr Krupp von Bohlen, Essen, <i>viâ</i> Rotterdam,
by kind favour of Messrs. Petersen &amp; Co.’ Hence
a most ingenious argument conducted on the
principle ‘You shut your eyes, I’ll keep mine
open.’ A consignment ‘to order’ (as ‘to the
order of Messrs. Petersen &amp; Co.’) may perhaps
be legitimately seized, because the words do not
clearly indicate the Dutch firm to be the real
purchasers; but certainly not a consignment
to a specific person (as to Messrs. Petersen &amp;
Co., Rotterdam). The sophistry is obvious; it
does not negative the possibility that Messrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Petersen &amp; Co. are either acting as buyers for,
or have imported the goods with the intention of
passing them on to, Herr Krupp of Essen. And
with the help of trade statistics the possibility
may be discovered to be a probability.</p>


<h3><i>Embargo</i></h3>

<p>And now the pendulum swings back, and in the
doctrine of embargo the really neutral merchant
comes into his own. ‘Embargo’ is the action
taken by a neutral Government in regard to
goods which have been declared to be contraband
by one or other of the belligerents; and the point
to be emphasised is that it springs directly out
of the doctrine of ‘continuous voyages.’ In order
to prevent neutral ships destined to its ports with
goods which one of the belligerents treats as contraband
being detained and searched at sea, it prohibits
the export of those goods from its own ports. The
embargo satisfies the belligerent that these goods
will not go out of the neutral country, and therefore
will not get directly or indirectly into the
hands of the enemy; he therefore feels justified
in letting those ships go free, for the doctrine of
‘continuous voyages’ cannot apply. Now the
reason for the embargo is that the merchants of
the neutral country require the commodity for
themselves. Suppose, for example, that Spanish
merchants require copper for their own use;
then in order to ensure cargoes of copper coming
direct to Spanish ports without being interfered
with at sea by the search of belligerent cruisers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the Spanish Government might put an embargo
on copper: that is to say, might prohibit its
export. There could be no better evidence that
the Spanish merchants were importing the copper
for their own trade, and that none of it would
get through to the enemy. I can therefore best
describe an embargo thus: It is action taken by
a neutral Government to protect those of its
merchants who do not desire to engage in trade
in contraband from the consequences which would
result from the action of those who do.</p>

<p>There is only one point in connexion with this
doctrine which requires attention. Is the action
thus taken by the neutral Government a breach of
its neutrality to the other belligerent? For, undoubtedly,
it does act favourably to the belligerent
who has declared the goods to be contraband. The
answer is simple. Once admit the strict logic of the
doctrine of ‘continuous voyages,’ it follows that
an embargo is a measure neither directed against
one belligerent nor imposed to favour the other.
It is simply a measure of self-defence, taken in
order to prevent the national industries from
suffering from the undoubted belligerent right of
detention at sea and possible seizure.</p>

<p>There are other occasions in which an embargo
may be resorted to, as in the case of the embargo
on rubber imported by Great Britain to which
reference has been made above.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> That is purely
a municipal question with which international
law can have no concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>


<h3><i>Blockade</i></h3>

<p>And now I come to the last point of all, blockade,
which is the supreme manifestation of force at
sea for the purpose of crushing the enemy. Here
all minor considerations vanish. The artificial
distinction between absolute and conditional contraband
disappears; there is no longer any free
list; neutral as well as enemy cargoes are subject
to seizure, whether going to or coming from the
blockaded port. The humanitarian concession that
war is not made on the civil population finds no
place; indeed, blockade derives much of its
efficacy from the pressure which the strangling
process brings to bear on that population. It
has been described as a siege carried on at sea, but
under somewhat more elastic conditions than a
land siege. It is a convenient comparison, because
all the outcry against its inhumanity is silenced
by the recollection of Paris in 1870, and the vision
of what Paris would have been in 1914 if the German
plan had succeeded. It is rigorous, almost brutal,
but it is war, and war admits of no half-measures
which come within the code of civilisation; and
this measure, extreme though it be, has long been
recognised as legitimate warfare. Nor is there
any conventional limitation as to the time when
it may be resorted to. Coming as it naturally
does at the end of the discussion to which other
principles have led up, it might appear as if custom
had decreed that it should only be resorted to after
all other measures had failed. But there is nothing
to prevent a war starting with a blockade; nothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
that is to say, in the theory of the subject, though
there are any number of practical reasons which
make it improbable. I presume, however, that
if a great maritime Power were at war with a State
which had only a miniature fleet, a blockade of
its coasts would be the speediest and, therefore, the
most humane way of bringing it to a conclusion.
Certainly there is no rule or custom which prevents
a Power at war from putting forth its full
strength at once.</p>

<p>The ascending scale is easier for purposes of
study; the mind grasps smaller things more
easily, and they prepare the way for the appreciation
of the greater things. But it is not by a
process of logical development that we reach
blockade after a study of contraband. Blockade
is treated last more conveniently because it involves
the greatest development of force against
the enemy; but it would have been more logical
to have begun at the other end of the scale, starting
with the greatest exhibition of force, and letting
the series of rules emerge in diminishing strength.
In view of what remains to be said, it is of great
importance to appreciate that the incarnation of
sea-power, blockade, which cuts the enemy off
absolutely from the outer world, lies at one end
of the scale of what one belligerent may do to
the other, and the seizure of contraband on a
neutral ship going to an enemy port, which cuts
the enemy off but partially, lies at the other end.
There can then be no difficulty in justifying what
comes in between.</p>

<p>But the most curious point is that it is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
when we come to the recognition of this extreme
manifestation of force that we meet with artificial
rules. A blockade must be ‘effective.’ Yet this
word, as to the meaning of which in its ordinary
use there can be no doubt, is given in treaties and
by the authorities a wholly artificial meaning.
Sometimes it includes the exact contrary to effectiveness,
as that ‘A blockade is not regarded as
raised if the blockading force is temporarily
withdrawn on account of stress of weather’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>:
during which the adventurous skipper may run
in. It is not necessary to labour the point; but
it is necessary, when measures short of ‘blockade’
have been taken by England, that the full extent
of what blockade pressure upon neutral trade
means should be understood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In order to determine what characterises a blockaded
port, that denomination is given only where there is, by
the disposition of the Power which attacks it with ships,
stationary or sufficiently near, an evident danger in
entering.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>A blockade [by cruising squadrons allotted to that
service, and duly competent to its execution] is valid
and legitimate, although there be no design to attack
or reduce by force the port or arsenal to which it is
applied, and that the fact of the blockade, with due notice
given to neutral Powers, shall affect not only vessels
actually intercepted in the attempt to enter the blockaded
port, but those also which shall be elsewhere met with
and shall be found to have been destined to such port,
with knowledge of the fact and notice of the blockade.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>These two quotations embody the principles of
the English prize law. Article 17 of the Declaration
of London contains a modification of them,
and provides that ‘neutral vessels may not be
captured for breach of blockade except within
the area of operations of the war-ships detailed
to render the blockade effective.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have come to the threshold of a subject of
gravest importance, the new policy of the British
Government adopted in answer to the ‘war-zone’
declaration of Germany, and I stop. To devote
to it merely the end of an already long article
would not be treating it with the consideration
which it deserves, and which the question demands.
Moreover, it would not be expedient for an ex-official
Englishman to discuss the subject controversially
at present. It is sufficient that the measure
has been adopted after full and mature consideration
by the Government, that the question is
political as well as legal, and for us it must be
taken to be within the legitimate powers of a belligerent.
Presently, to judge from what has already
happened, there certainly will be any amount of
nonsense talked and written about it; already the
term ‘paper-blockade’ has come in handily for the
making of a paragraph, and some bold spirit has
hit upon a brand-new term, ‘long-distance blockade.’
Also there has been some not very wise
talk about ‘Two wrongs not making a right.’
I would suggest to those who feel irresistibly
impelled to discuss the question that they should
omit the word ‘blockade,’ for, as we have seen, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
is a pernicketty term, and all sorts of legal niceties
spring up in its train. I have endeavoured to show
that ‘blockade’ is the extreme manifestation of
the force known as sea-power against the enemy,
that sea-power lies at the root of the authority
which has been given to the series of principles
governing belligerent interference with neutral
trade, and that these principles are not a mere
adventitious set of rules drawn up at odd times as
wars at sea occasioned them. The principles and
the rules have resulted from the play of natural
forces, exerted by the belligerents on the one side,
by the neutral merchant on the other. The rules
are not even a compromise. The clash of forces
has thrown off alternating sparks, rules recognising
now the right of the one, now the right of the
other. But in the supreme display of sea-power
known as ‘blockade’ we find that the right of
the belligerent does, as is inevitable, take the
upper hand, and the right of the neutral disappears.
And there are two French maxims worthy of note
just now: ‘<i>Qui veut les fins veut les moyens</i>,’ and
‘<i>Qui peut plus peut moins</i>.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P.S.—I must briefly refer to two questions
which appear at first sight to conflict with the
principles advanced in this article—Foreign
Enlistment, and the King’s Proclamations of
Neutrality.</p>

<p>Before agreeing with the United States as to
the ‘Three Rules’ which, as I have pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
deal solely with ‘foreign enlistment,’ the British
Government declared that they could not assent
to the contention that those rules were a statement
of principles of international law in force
at the time when the <i>Alabama</i> claims arose. This
is expressly stated in Article 6 of the Treaty of
Washington. ‘Historicus,’ in one of his Letters,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
cites some American authorities which bear out
this view. Further, he explains the true inwardness
of the Foreign Enlistment Act:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Enlistment Act is directed, not against the <i>animus
vendendi</i>, but against the <i>animus belligerendi</i>.</p>

<p>It prohibits warlike enterprise, but it does not interfere
with commercial adventure. A subject of the Crown
may sell a ship of war, as he may sell a musket, to either
belligerent with impunity; nay, he may even despatch
it for sale to the belligerent port. But he may not take
part in the overt act of making war upon a people with
whom his Sovereign is at peace. The purview of the
Foreign Enlistment Act is to prohibit a breach of allegiance
on the part of the subject against his own Sovereign,
not to prevent transactions in contraband with the belligerent.
Its object is to prohibit private war, and not
to restrain private commerce.</p>
</div>

<p>It is only when it has become the subject of
agreement between two or more States that
‘foreign enlistment’ assumes an international as
well as a municipal character. I presume that this
municipal character has not been lost by the
inclusion of the duty to prevent the fitting out
or arming of vessels in Article 8 of the Hague
Convention, No. 13, of 1907, relating to the duties
of Neutral Powers in Maritime War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>As to the Proclamations of Neutrality, so
much as recites and reinforces the Foreign Enlistment
Act need not trouble us; the King’s loving
subjects are exhorted to comply therewith. The
rest of the Proclamations amounts to no more
than a warning to subjects not to do ‘any acts
in derogation of their duty as subjects of a
neutral Power in a war between other Powers,
or in violation or contravention of the law of
nations in that behalf’; but, as ‘Historicus’
says,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> ‘The nature of the penalty is pointed out
with equal clearness and correctness—<i>viz.</i> the
withdrawal of the King’s protection from the
contraband on its road to the enemy, and an
abandonment of the subject to the operation of
belligerent rights.’ What those belligerent rights
are I have endeavoured to explain.</p>

<p>The quality of diplomatic courtesy between the
United States and Germany is much strained,
for the submarine pirates have sunk American
ships, and have drowned American citizens bound
on their lawful errands on British ships. On the
14th of May, Germany was informed for the second
time that she would be held to strict accountability
for any infringement of the rights of American
citizens, whether intentional or accidental, and
in her methods of attack against the trade of her
enemies she was called on no longer to disregard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
‘those rules of fairness, reason, justice, and humanity,
which all modern opinion regards as imperative.’
On the 11th of June, the defence that the <i>Lusitania</i>
was carrying contraband was brushed aside as
irrelevant to the question of the legality of those
methods. The German reply being evasive and
justificatory, on the 23rd of July a third warning
was given: if the offence should continue unabated
the action would be treated as ‘deliberately unfriendly.’
These Notes derive their dignity from
their obvious restraint, from the measured insistence
of their words, and from the scrupulous exactitude
in the statement of the principles they appeal to.
No saner judgment was ever pronounced against
a criminal, and, though a golden bridge has been
offered for retreat, they will stand against Germany
as a permanent record of her iniquity.</p>

<p>But a curiously paradoxical situation arises
with regard to ourselves. The very virtue of these
Notes is bound to react to our prejudice; for
other neutrals may too readily assume that those
same high qualities are also to be found in the
Note of the 30th of March, protesting against the
British Order in Council issued as a reply to the
German submarine attacks on merchant shipping
in the ‘war-zone.’ There is also a minute minority
of our own people who have a perverse habit of
thinking that ‘after all’ we <i>may</i> be wrong, and
they will not fail to apply their favourite doctrine
in this case.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the War, far-off though
it be, we can already see one question which will
be insistent for solution: what effect will it have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
had on international law? It is essential, if
England is to preserve her high place in the councils
of the nations, that the sincerity of her words
should not be open to question through any act
which could be brought up against her of even
doubtful legality. This Protest alleges that there
is no doubt as to the illegality of our so-called
blockade of Germany. With profound respect,
I believe the Protest to be unsound in its premises
and inaccurate in its conclusions, and that there
is as complete an answer to it as to the previous
Notes addressed by the United States Government
to this country. But it has put a weapon into
the hands of our enemy of which he has not been
slow to avail himself; it has given Herr Dernburg
a plank to dance on instead of a slack-rope; it
has played upon the imagination of Mr. Norman
Angell, who has been for so long engaged in shattering
the illusions of others, and provided him with
an illusion all his own. In the May number of
the <i>North American Review</i> he has caught some
ideas hitherto floating in the air and shaped them
into a new peace-theory which he believes will
be acceptable to the American Government, and
I presume, to other countries also. He has given
it for title ‘The Neutralization of the Sea.’</p>


<h3><i>Mr. Norman Angell’s Plan for the Neutralization
of the Sea</i></h3>

<p>Mr. Norman Angell is a serious writer. He
has detected the weak points in what is called
the ‘arbitrament of war,’ and has formulated his
indictment against it in a series of concrete propositions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
The wilderness of the world’s foolishness
so re-echoed with his words that some thought
they saw the wild rose blossoming. Yet, though
the wilderness still breeds the thistle, his theories
rested on a substratum of fact, and set people
thinking when he first spoke to them. But his
last excursion into the regions of the Unattainable
has no such merit; he has been busy dreaming
other men’s dreams. He foresees this contingency,
which ‘English opinion has absolutely failed to
envisage,’ that at the conclusion of the War America
will see to it that ‘sea-law as it stands, and as
America has accepted it,’ is ‘changed altogether.’
He says that ‘there is in England not the faintest
realisation that the inevitable outcome of the
present contraband and blockade difficulties will
be an irresistible movement in America, for the
neutralization of the high seas, or, failing that,
their domination by the American Navy.’ So
much of this as relates to England is perfectly
true; there has not been ‘a line of discussion
concerning it in the Press,’ for the all-sufficient
reason that it is the ‘very coinage’ of Mr. Norman
Angell’s brain, the ‘bodiless creation’ of his
ecstasy. That ‘profound conflict of policy’ which,
after unnumbered years, is to end in the transfer
of the command of the sea across the Atlantic
is not ‘even being discussed in England’; and it
is therefore consoling to know that ‘it is probable
that very many Americans themselves do not
realise clearly how this dispute is developing, and
how the United States will be pushed to take
a stand for a profound alteration of the entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
maritime situation.’ With this the phantasy of
the ‘neutralization of the sea’ might be dismissed.
It is a dangerous topic to discuss at this
time, especially in America, with so uncertain a
knowledge of ‘sea-law’ as Mr. Norman Angell
displays; for others besides pacifist doctrinaires
are making great play with it to the same audience—to
wit, our enemies. Yet this advocate of peace
threatens us with war if we will not accept his
great illusion—war with the United States! And
in order to avoid this conflict, ‘which certainly
no one who wishes well to the two countries would
care to contemplate,’ he demands the sacrifice
of every principle on which we found our belief
that Right must ultimately become Might. I
can only assume that he does not see that the
result would be the greater prevalence of the
German doctrine that Might is Supreme.</p>

<p>We were once interested by Mr. Norman Angell’s
studies in the ‘might have been’: were even
ready to agree that as ‘might be’ they were worthy
of serious consideration. But, frankly, his countrymen
have no wish that England should be the
<i>corpus vile</i> on which this new experiment is to
be tried. The Platitudinarians rejoiced when he
came over to them; but Mr. Norman Angell is
too serious a student for such company. Let
him then, as other Englishmen who have attacked
England have done, recant; I will find him
excellent reason. He is not too familiar with
the subject on which he has now laid profane
hands. He has been struck with the glint of
a phrase, but I am sure he does not know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the ‘neutralization of the sea’ really means. It
means, first, that the high sea is to be forbidden
to men-of-war of any nation whatsoever; secondly,
that the high sea shall not be used by neutrals
for war purposes—that is, for supplying belligerents
with munitions of war: alternatively,
that they should supply each belligerent alike
without interference from the other; thirdly,
that their trade in non-contraband should go on
as if there were no war.</p>

<p>The ‘neutralization of the sea’ is therefore
a convenient formula which may be substituted
for that occult paragraph of the German reply
to the American Note of the 12th of February, the
meaning of which I have endeavoured to give in
my first article: that little lecture to the American
trader on the subject of ‘the practice of right,’ and
‘the toleration of wrong.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The paraphrase of this new formula is more
easy. First: wars shall cease upon the high seas;
and as ‘men-of-war’ obviously include transports,
wars will thenceforward be confined to
continents; bellicose islands will never again be
allowed to participate. Permanent peace will
thus be established in part of the world; and
for the rest, seeing that you cannot expect to
achieve everything at once, there must be just one
more war, in which Germany will reduce Russia
to impotence, absorb the small States, and crush
France and Italy without the interference of
troublesome over-sea soldiers; after which the
beatific vision of a permanent Teutonic peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Secondly: with regard to so much of the
formula as relates to neutrals, the justice of it
must become apparent if you introduce as a
prelude the tearful appeal so often heard of late
from Berlin—‘You pray for peace, and yet you
arm our enemies to fight.’ It is unkind to substitute
for this—‘You will not let us crush our
enemies in our own way’; yet it is its exact
equivalent; and reduced to a practical proposition
it means this, that when nations go to war they
must fight with their own resources, which not even
the dreamiest of the Pacifists would assent to,
for then those little nations, in whose prosperity
Mr. Norman Angell so much believes,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> would go
to the wall. It would give the strong States the
power to crush them, picking their quarrel when
and how they will. But if you will not agree to
this so-simple proposition, then, for goodness’
as well as for profit’s sake, be logical and trade
with both belligerents alike; do not let yourselves
‘be influenced in the direction of conscious
wilful restriction’ by so trivial a matter as the
‘command of the sea.’ Sea-power on which it
rests must be abolished altogether, which would
be a great step towards permanent peace.</p>


<p>With the bearing of the ‘command of the
sea’ upon the third phrase of its ‘neutralization’
this article specially concerns itself.</p>

<p>All this and more lies between the extremes
of Mr. Norman Angell’s threat; either this, or
the United States will take the command of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
sea into its own hands. One may reasonably
doubt whether this view commends itself to
President Wilson; whether it has even entered
the minds of the ‘influential backers’ of the
demand for an enormously increased American
fleet. Yet, if I may say it with profound respect,
it is only another manifestation of the fundamental
misunderstanding of the law of war which
characterises the Protest itself.</p>

<p>Whether it be possible for the same end to be
achieved by different means, the one lawful, the
other unlawful, is a problem in casuistry which
I shall not attempt to solve; but as a rough-and-ready
rule of practical life we may take it
that when two people seek to achieve equal ends
they are equal to one another. Now the offensive
Herr Dernburg—I use the term in no offensive
sense, for I would not exclude myself from his
Kirkwall compliment<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>—desires to forbid the sea
to English cruisers in order that American vessels
may not be let or hindered when they carry harmless
‘raw material’ to German ports. He asserts
that any domination exercised beyond territorial
waters which interferes with them ‘is a breach
and an infringement of the rights of others.’ The
<i>Emden’s</i> raids on our commerce, carefully prepared
and charted, ‘if my gossip Report be an
honest woman of her word,’ two years before
the War, are sufficient to show that this new
opinion has sprung from the emergencies of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
present moment. And the unoffensive Mr. Norman
Angell also desires that the English cruisers should
cease their vigil, in order that American vessels
may help to complete ‘vast commercial arrangements’
entered into by some ‘Chicago or New
York magnate’ with the German Government.</p>

<p>Applying then my rough-and-ready rule, Mr.
Norman Angell and Herr Dernburg, desiring to
achieve the same end, cannot be on opposite sides
of the fray. Mr. Norman Angell has been beguiled
by the sad picture which the Germans have drawn
of starving Germany. Starvation, alas! is one
of the weapons of war. The Germans have made
full use of it in the past; and had their plans
not miscarried Paris would again have lived on
the vermin of the sewers, as it did in 1870. Mr.
Norman Angell’s memory does not run to that
period; but he lives in a time when what he
conceives to be the possible result of British
war policy has become the actual policy of the
invader of Belgium: almost a whole nation ‘reduced
to absolute starvation, including the women
and the children,’ by the direct action of the
German Government in preventing the distribution
of American food. His vision is clouded
by the pathos of imaginary pictures; he does not
see what is going on before his eyes, and he allows
himself to be blinded to the real object of all
the German manœuvring diplomacy, to which
the ‘Foodstuffs’ cry is but a convenient screen.
An embargo on the export of munitions of war
from the United States to the Allies Germany
will secure if she can, by hook or crook, by fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
means or foul, by argument or threat, by cajolery
or intimidation, for necessity is driving her. Her
one hope of salvation lies in getting the United
States to break its neutrality, and the accomplishment
of this ignoble task has been confided
to the Bernstorffs, the Dernburgs, the Ballins,
κ.τ.λ. These passionately exhort the Government
of the States to control by domestic legislation
its merchants’ commerce with the Allies,
because the British Fleet in its right of war is
controlling their commerce with Germany. The
German Admiralty has substituted piracy for
war on the sea; and now, powerless to enforce
its war right, it struggles to achieve the same
results by the devious process of an American
embargo. To enforce their rights of war nations
sacrifice the lives of men; Germany to make
good her lost rights is willing to sacrifice a
friendly State. In furtherance of this, unconsciously
I feel sure, Mr. Norman Angell has lent
his facile pen, and he threatens us with war with
the United States unless we forgo the benefits
which the command of the sea has given us. If
it were possible to imagine President Wilson to
acquiesce by so much as the movement of his
little finger, granting to Germany any fraction
of the indirect help she so urgently needs, then
indeed clouds would gather on the horizon—there
is no half-way house between neutrality
and alliance with the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
rest assured there is no such possibility. Before,
therefore, Mr. Norman Angell further develops
his theory I would commend to his study those
mighty disputations concerning the ‘freedom of
the sea’ which were held twenty years ago between
the United States and Great Britain, <i>quorum pars
parvula fui</i>. <i>We</i> knew what we were quarrelling
about. But Germany! She tells the unlistening
world that she is fighting for ‘the traditional
<i>mare liberum</i>’! What can this <i>parvenu</i> of the
high seas know of its traditions? And for the
delectation of pacifist ears this programme has
been arranged: ‘a free sea,’ which shall mean
‘the cessation of the danger of war and the stopping
of world-wars,’ and ‘the sending of troops and
war machines into the territory of others or into
neutralized ports’ is to be ‘declared a <i>casus belli</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
From which it appears that the proposed remedy
will hardly cure the disease.</p>

<p>‘It is with no mere idle use of high-sounding
phrase that Great Britain once more appears
to vindicate the freedom of the sea.’ Thus we
spoke in the argument in the Behring Sea Arbitration.
And we may continue so to speak with
clearest conscience; for a careful scrutiny will
show that the principle of the Order in Council
is new, if you will, but in legitimate sequence
from well-established doctrines, and has sprung
from them in an ordered and scientific development.
Of the American Protest which criticises
it, speaking with all due respect for the learned
authors of it, it is, I venture to think, open on
its destructive side to this general remark: that
it enunciates old doctrines in their popular form
without that full examination of the underlying
principles which the grave state of the world’s
affairs demands. On its constructive side, however,
it is interesting and worthy of careful study.</p>


<h3><i>General View of the Main Provision of the Order
in Council</i></h3>

<p>Let us get at once a clear view of the position.
England by this Order has aimed a very vigorous
blow at the heart of her enemy, but the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of the United States has warned her that
she may not do it, not from any humanitarian
considerations, but because it would react to
the detriment of neutral merchants. It points out
that there are some principles of international
law, some documents or declarations, which stand
in our way. If this be really so, then international
law sets the profit of the merchant above the life of
nations. The theory of the United States appears
to be that the conduct of war is to be governed
by the interests of commerce, even if they touch
those of the belligerents. The truer theory is,
I believe, that commerce, in so far as it touches
the interests of the belligerents, is entirely subordinated
to the exigencies of war. If the view
of the United States is right, then the documents
and the declarations have been heedlessly signed
and made, and the power of England upon the
seas has been recklessly frittered away.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured in the first article to get
into sharper relief than popular notions give to
it the position in which the neutral merchant
stands to a belligerent and to his own Government,
and also to recall the real meaning of
neutrality. The Order in Council had at that
time been issued, but the American Protest had
not been delivered. I intimated, however, that
it seemed probable that a close examination of
fundamental principles would show that the Order
was abundantly justified by them. The publication
of the Protest confirms me in that view.</p>

<p>And, first, I venture to contest the main
doctrines on which the criticism of the Order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
rests.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> I deny that a belligerent nation has been
<i>conceded</i> ‘the right of visit and search, and the right
of capture and condemnation’ of neutral ships
engaged in unneutral service or carrying contraband
for the enemy. I deny that a belligerent
nation has been <i>conceded</i> ‘the right to establish
and maintain a blockade of an enemy’s ports
and coasts and to capture and condemn any vessel
taken in trying to break the blockade.’ On the
contrary, I assert that these are <i>belligerent rights</i>
which may be <i>asserted</i> and exercised against the
neutral merchant whose vessels are engaged in
rendering those services to the enemy: that consequently
‘a nation’s sovereignty over its own
ships and citizens under its own flag on the high
seas’ does suffer ‘diminution in times of war’
to the full extent to which a belligerent exercises
those rights: and that to this extent ‘the equality
of sovereignty on the high seas’ finds no place in
war. And I further contend that the proposition,
to the establishment of which all the argument
of the Protest tends—that ‘innocent shipments
may be freely transported to and from the United
States through neutral countries to belligerents’
territory’ without risk of seizure and confiscation—is
not true when one of the belligerent Governments
has declared its intention of stopping all
shipments, and has taken effective steps to enforce
that intention. If the proposition were true in
these circumstances the Order in Council would
be a breach of international law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>


<h3><i>Application of the Law of Vendor and Purchaser</i></h3>

<p>Before making good this position a preliminary
point raised by the Protest must be dealt with—the
bearing of the Declaration of Paris on the
question. Even the learned must have been somewhat
confused by the isolated, almost casual,
reference to one of its rules—‘Free ships make
free goods’; or to be more accurate, ‘The neutral
flag covers enemy’s goods, with the exception of
contraband of war.’ Its relation to the context
is more than obscure, for this rule applies to the
seizure of <i>enemy property</i>, whereas the doctrines
on which the law of contraband and the law of
blockade rest apply to the seizure of <i>neutral property</i>.
It is clear, therefore, that there are two
very distinct planes of thought, and we cannot
step lightly from one to the other without putting
in peril the logical structure of the discussion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘The rules of the Declaration of Paris of 1856, among
them that free ships make free goods, will hardly at this
day be disputed by the signatories of that solemn
agreement.’</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, and no more, the Protest. The United
States is not a signatory to the Declaration, and
its final clause provides that it ‘is not and shall
not be binding, except between those Powers
who have acceded, or shall accede to it.’ But let
us put this technical objection on one side and,
admitting the rule to be a generally accepted
principle, see what it has to do with the question
in dispute.</p>

<p>The merchant promotes his trade with foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
parts by many ways, but he never loses sight
of one essential: payment for his goods. It is
true that credit is the life of commerce; but
during war conditions are changed, and while it
may be that some still adhere to peace-time customs,
the ‘rumble of the distant drum’ induces
others, probably the more numerous, certainly
the wiser, to ‘take the cash and let the credit go.’
On the other hand, the purchaser’s object is to
get the goods, more especially if he is a belligerent
and the goods munitions of war: and one very
sure way of obtaining possession of the document
of title to them is by paying cash or by giving
some substitute which the vendor accepts as its
equivalent. Thus cash enables the wishes of both
parties to be satisfied; and the law facilitates
the acquisition of property after a sale by means
of the contract for delivery of goods ‘f.o.b.,’
free on board, under which the property passes to
the purchaser from the moment the goods are
on board ship. Now it is obvious that if the
neutral merchant is wise in his generation he will,
having in view the risks ahead of him, secure
payment for his goods and get rid of them ‘f.o.b.’
Then all those troublesome questions of seizure
by belligerent cruisers and condemnation by
Prize Courts concern <i>him</i> no longer. The goods
become enemy cargoes consigned to one of the
belligerents, the vendor has got his money, and
they may go to the bottom of the deep blue sea,
or into the factories of the other belligerent, for
all he cares.</p>

<p>Here then is the puzzle. Seeing that the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
makes such ample provision for his protection,
allows him to trade in such fashion that he can
with safety and profit get rid of his troublesome
property in cargoes when he has shipped them,
even in cargoes of contraband of war, what is
the meaning of all this talk about the violation of
the rights of the neutral merchant upon the high
seas? They have vanished; and even the ingenuous
protests against the too strenuous application
of the doctrine of ‘continuous voyages’ lose
much of their pathos when we realise that the
cargoes (of, say, cotton, copper, rubber, or even
foodstuffs) seized on their way to neutral ports
may not be, need not be if he has exercised reasonable
care, the neutral vendor’s property at all.
They ought to be enemy property, or at best the
property of purchasers in ‘countries which, though
neutral, are contiguous to the nations at war’;
and then the plaint should come from this
side of the Atlantic. The whole question has
now taken a different aspect, and the presumption,
based on overwhelming statistics, that <i>these</i> neutral
purchasers are acting as agents for the enemy, or
are anticipating enormous profits from sales to the
enemy, is wholly justified and most pertinent to
the issue. Looking therefore at the case in the
rough, the neutral American vendor, if he has
acted with common prudence, is out of Court as
a complainant. And, further, his position is vastly
different from an ethical standpoint if he has
chosen to give credit to the enemy, or to a purchaser
who is probably the enemy’s agent; still more
different, almost dwindles to vanishing-point, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
he has sent the goods on the chance of ‘payment
if safe delivery.’ From a purely commercial point
of view, therefore, if seizures of such cargoes are
to be made the basis of complaint by the Government
as the legitimate mouthpiece of United
States traders in the bulk, the only possible ground
on which it could be presented is that they may
affect trade generally; the complaint would be
of ‘the injury to American commerce as a whole,’
as it was, in fact, put in the Note of the 28th of
December.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But then the damage is too remote
from the alleged wrongful injury to sustain a
plea. Interference with trade is the inevitable
consequence of war; the more strenuously sea-power
is exercised the greater the interference,
and the command of the sea inevitably makes
the interference one-sided.</p>

<p>But it may, with respect, be questioned whether
the allegation is correct. The effect of war on
commerce <i>generally</i> must be judged by its results
on commerce <i>as a whole</i>; there must be a general
balance-sheet of United States trade in which the
profits of some merchants must be set against the
losses of others. Is it quite certain that American
commerce as a whole has not derived much benefit
from the War rather than suffered serious loss?
There seems to be some confusion of the particular
with the general. In regard to this ground of
complaint war is entitled to the same treatment
as the public good, which is never condemned
for the individual wrong it does and must do,
or the world would have stood still long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The position of affairs may, therefore, be stated
very clearly: only in those cases in which the property
in the cargoes seized has not passed out of the
vendor do the questions of contraband and blockade
affect him. But where the property has passed
to an enemy purchaser or his agent, then other
questions arise which depend on the Declaration
of Paris.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<h3><i>The Declaration of Paris—Free Ships make
Free Goods</i></h3>

<p>The Declaration of Paris has been roundly
abused by many who believe that it clipped the
wings of England’s sea-power, having been expressly
designed thereto and weakly assented to by
England. This provision—‘Free ships make free
goods’—covers goods consigned to an enemy
Government! But looking at it merely as it affects
neutral merchants, it fails lamentably as a practical
doctrine, because in the attempt at conciseness its
authors forgot to be explicit. As it stands it is not
true. It has not interfered with the right of search
because contraband of war is excepted, and the
fundamental argument that you cannot seize if
you cannot search, ‘whatever be the ships, whatever
be the cargoes, whatever be their destination,’<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
still holds good. Nor has it interfered with or
curtailed the rights incident to blockade; then
the doctrine of the Declaration vanishes, for there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
are no ‘free ships’ by which the enemy’s goods
may be made free, all goods on board being liable
to seizure.</p>

<p>But the great defect of the provision is that
it leaves deplorably vague the question by whom
the ‘freedom’ of the enemy goods may be raised:
by the neutral carrier or the enemy owner; and
it is precisely this point which seems to have been
ignored in the American Protest.</p>

<p>This question also arises very directly under
the Order in Council, for the first clause provides
that the goods discharged from a neutral vessel
seized on its voyage to a German port, other than
contraband of war, shall, if they are not requisitioned
for the use of His Majesty, ‘be restored
by order of the Court, upon such terms as the
Court may in the circumstances deem to be just,
to the person entitled thereto.’ Now, if the property
in the cargo has by law passed to an enemy
purchaser certain questions as to the making
of the order would, I presume, arise, which for
obvious reasons I do not discuss. But it is quite
certain that the American vendor could not appear
and make the claim on behalf of such a purchaser;
equally certain that the United States Government
would have no <i>locus standi</i>. The position
under the Order in Council is the same as would
arise in normal circumstances if, for example,
the question before a Prize Court were as to the
‘effectiveness’ of a blockade. The neutral owner
of the ship would argue the case on his own behalf,
but not on behalf of an enemy owner of the cargo.
As, therefore, the United States Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
could not argue the legal case on behalf of an
enemy purchaser, and as enemy purchasers are
the persons specially cared for by this rule of the
Declaration of Paris, it is difficult to see how it
can argue the question diplomatically. But, not
being altogether inexperienced in diplomacy, it has
limited its protest to the case of its neutral merchants.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Then, with great deference, the invocation
of the Declaration of Paris is irrelevant, for
the whole point of the clause is the freedom of the
goods and not the freedom of the ship; and
the question of the freedom of the ship cannot
be raised, because the exception of contraband of
war from the rule carries with it a forced submission
to the belligerent right of search. And,
further, the question whether the Order in Council
is an illegal extension of the law of blockade is
not affected by the Declaration, but must be
decided on other grounds.</p>

<p>But ‘quick returns make rich merchants,’
whether they result from small profits or large.
And in war-time the neutral merchant, being a mere
man of commerce, appears to be quite ready to
‘pay for the boundless gain’ which the sale of
munitions gives him by taking the ‘boundless risk’
of seizure and condemnation, keeping the property
in his cargoes while they are on the high seas.
Should disaster follow, there is always ‘the Government’
to fall back on; and if only it can be persuaded
to wave the banner of ‘neutral rights’ with
sufficient dexterity, the chances are in favour of
compensation. Now, if all neutral merchants would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
take Reason for their guide the Declaration of Paris
would reveal hitherto unsuspected virtues. Let
me commend the following brief articles to the
consideration of the diplomatic professors at the
next Hague Conference: First—‘For the future
avoidance of tortuous discussions so common in
the past, the law of contraband, and so much of
the law of blockade as affects neutral merchants,
are hereby abolished, and all contracts for the
sale of all goods whatsoever made between neutral
and belligerent merchants shall for all purposes be
deemed to be contracts f.o.b.’ Secondly—‘For
the greater peace of the world, and the prevention
of those financial difficulties hitherto so commonly
resulting to private individuals from war, it is
agreed that “free ships make free goods”; so
only that such free ships, whatever be their cargoes,
whatever be their destination, may be taken by
either belligerent, without undue show of force
or unnecessary use of explosives, into his nearest
port, there to abide the decision of a Prize Court
whether they be goods designed for the use of
the enemy forces; and, if it be shown to the
satisfaction of the Court that they be not so designed,
then they shall be declared to be “free
goods,” and if the person entitled thereto be a
neutral they shall be delivered up to him on such
conditions as the Court shall think just; but if
he be an enemy, other than the enemy Government,
then they shall be held until the conclusion
of peace, when they shall be delivered up.’</p>

<p>Is this a scheme straight from the Councils
of Utopia? I wonder! Perhaps for the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
it may be left with the judicial formula ‘I should
like to hear the point argued.’ But this is certain,
that if contracts with belligerents were made
with the same business caution as contracts in
peace-time, all the clamour about the ‘rights
of neutral merchants’ would die down, for they
would have none which need protection, and
Notes of friendly remonstrance and dexterously
worded Protests would be unnecessary. But we
live in an age of great unreason; and the law
of contraband and all that part of the law of
blockade which affects neutral merchants have been
the inevitable result. The Declaration of Paris
might have got rid of many difficulties with a
little more study of actual facts, but it has not;
and so, in spite of good intention, we must wrestle,
and I propose now to wrestle, with the problems
it has left unsolved.</p>


<h3><i>The Effect of the Order in Council</i></h3>

<p>The essential condition of blockade, as hitherto
understood, is that the blockading squadron must
be in the immediate offing of the blockaded port.
We have placed our cruiser cordon at a considerable
distance from the German coast. And here,
to the general, is the stumbling-block in our way;
to the American, is the sign of our backsliding.
Yet, curiously enough, <i>if we had declared a blockade</i>,
any question which might have arisen as to its
validity owing to the position of the cordon is
set at rest by the Protest itself.</p>

<p>The rules of international law can only preserve
their vitality if they keep pace with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
progress of science; if they do not, they must
pass into the limbo of forgotten things. Hence
the necessity for a clear discernment between
essential principle and unessential detail. In the
first article I pointed out that this discernment
was singularly lacking in the early protests of
the United States Government. The details of
our doings on the high seas were criticised as not
being in conformity with action which tradition
justified; our all-sufficient answer was that they
were justified by the principles on which the
traditional action was based. Now although, as
I think, in this last Protest the American Government
has judged what we have done by the narrow
formulas of a bygone age, when it comes to treat
of ‘blockade’ it frankly abandons them; it literally
leaps forward, and brushing them aside shows
us that we might have taken other measures of
belligerent discipline which would have reacted far
more seriously against the neutral merchant than
those embodied in the Order. The American
Government believes—it is, when untroubled by
the complainings of its merchants, far too profound
a student not to believe—that the law of blockade
greatly needs rewriting. Rules which were adapted
to Nelson’s frigates can have little or no application
to the battle-cruisers of to-day. But they
were the outcome of a principle, and that principle
remains. The American Government agrees that
for a blockade the cordon of ships in the offing
is no longer practicable in the face of an enemy
‘possessing the means and opportunity to make
an effective defence by the use of submarines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
mines, and aircraft,’ and is therefore no longer to
be insisted on. It believes that a ‘long-distance
blockade’ is now inevitable. The importance of
this admission cannot be exaggerated. It might,
I should have thought, be contended that a
‘blockade’ cannot be effective if the enemy
possesses sufficient means of offence—in other
words, has the present means of destroying its
effectiveness. It can never be sufficiently insisted
on that ‘blockade’ has, in addition to its realities,
a technical and highly artificial side. Under the
conditions of warfare existing at the time the
rules were evolved, the visible sign of its effectiveness
was the presence of the blockading ships in
the offing; that was the fact from which the
danger to merchant ships trying to run in to
the blockaded coast became evident. But if,
whether by submarines, mines, or aircraft, this
danger ceases to be evident, if it can be actually
eliminated, if by the offensive protection of destroyers
or cruisers there is an evident danger
to the blockading squadron, it would seem to
follow that both the real and the artificial effectiveness
of that squadron would be destroyed. A
blockade liable to be seriously questioned, the
blockading ships to be annihilated, by an opposing
squadron, seems to involve a contradiction in
terms.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But all this is top-hamper of curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
argument, and must go by the board when modern
fleets take up their war-stations. The enforcement
of a ‘long-distance blockade’ is recognised
by the American Protest as being one of their
modern duties. But for what purpose? For that
extreme exhibition of force which the command
of the sea enables one of the belligerents to display
in order to strangle the life out of the enemy.
That is the principle of blockade—the exercise of
sea-power to stop <i>all</i> supplies from going to the
enemy, because he has that power; and the Protest
admits that this power may now be exercised
in a wider area than in days gone by: exercised
against the enemy, and therefore exercised against
the neutral merchant, whose chances of getting even
those things to the enemy which had, before its
exercise, been allowed to pass as non-contraband
are correspondingly diminished. Let it be noted
at once in italics that this admission comes from
a Government which is the most powerful protester
against infringements of what it holds to be the
rights of neutral merchants.</p>

<p>The learned student detects here what appears
to be an obvious flaw in the argument. He has
been taught that ‘a blockade must not extend
beyond the ports and coasts belonging to or
occupied by the enemy,’ and that ‘the blockading
forces must not bar access to neutral ports or
coasts.’ The first and eighteenth articles of the
Declaration of London have thus summarised
the practice. The Government of the United
States has not forgotten those elementary maxims;
but it will not let them interfere with the development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of its theory of the ‘long-distance blockade.’
The principle on which they are based can well
be preserved: ‘If the necessities of the case
should seem to render it imperative that the
cordon of blockading vessels be extended across
the approaches to any neighbouring neutral port
or country, it would seem clear that it would
still be practicable to comply with the well-recognised
and reasonable prohibition of international
law against the blockading of neutral
ports by according free admission and exit to
all lawful traffic with neutral ports through the
blockading cordon.’</p>

<p>Very frankly, I have my doubts as to the
soundness of the American contention. When
this time of warfare is overpast and only its echoes
remain, when another Conference shall assemble
at the Hague to endeavour to read its lessons
more surely than its predecessors had learnt those
of previous wars, I doubt whether this new
doctrine of blockade will find much favour; for
if it is accepted as an ‘effective blockade’ the
artificial side of the law must also be accepted,
and a temporary withdrawal on account of stress
of weather must be declared not to raise it.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But
of this I have no doubt, that the principle on
which blockade rests will always be recognised,
must always be recognised because it is a fact—that
a belligerent will, and therefore, as we are
used to say, ‘may,’ resort to the final strangling
process whenever he has the power, because he
has the power; of this no arbitrary rules can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
deprive him. I believe that when things come
to be weighed in the balance, when Time’s just
sentence is pronounced, it will be that the new
Order in Council indicates the proper method
by which a belligerent may, in view of the advance
in the methods of naval warfare, now exercise
that strenuous and strangling pressure upon the
enemy which in old days he was entitled to do
by means of a technical blockade, and that in
the way it deals with the neutral merchant it
has found the correct solution of that part of
the problem.</p>

<p>A great point is also made by the United States
Government that the Order in Council is invalid
because, if it is to be considered as a blockade,
it discriminates against the United States and is
not enforced against those countries which, owing
to their contiguity to Germany, are inside the
cruiser cordon. The principle on which this complaint
is based is thus given in Article 5 of the
Declaration of London:—‘A blockade must be
applied impartially to the ships of all nations.’
This principle is an integral part of the old system
of blockade, under which access to neutral ports
or coasts may not be barred by the blockading
forces (Article 18 of the Declaration). But it is
manifest that directly the principle of the ‘long-distance
blockade’ is admitted the access to
neutral ports must be interfered with; and the
Protest expressly recognises the necessity of admitting
this principle. Moreover, it would seem
that Article 5 of the Declaration applies to an
intentional discrimination between the ships of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
different countries by the blockading belligerent.
It is clear that the United States Government
does not interpret the article to be, from reasons
of geography, an impediment to the new form of
blockade which it has expressly approved.</p>


<h3><i>The Relation between Contraband of War and
Blockade</i></h3>

<p>Let me now try to make things a little clearer.
We are so accustomed to the grooves in which
our thoughts have been trained to run that we
are apt to overlook the intimate connexion which
exists between the law of contraband of war and the
law of blockade. They are treated as isolated doctrines,
as independent branches of the law. The
American Protest declares them to be separate
‘concessions’ by neutrals to belligerents. Discussed,
as they are, in terms which have no common
denomination of language, comparison between
them has become, if not impossible, certainly
unusual.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Let us then reduce them to a common
denominator. If we talk of both in terms of
belligerent action we find in the law of contraband
the right of search as a preliminary to seizure,
in the law of blockade the right of seizure without
search. In terms of the cargo seized, we find
the first limited to contraband of war, the second
unlimited. But this is not very satisfactory; it
does not explain why, if the neutral merchant has
any <i>rights</i> in regard to non-contraband, the belligerent
may destroy them by declaring a blockade.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
It appears to lead to some such general principle
as this: when neutral vessels come within a
certain distance from the enemy’s coasts (the
offing) a belligerent may seize anything and everything,
but until they come within that distance he
can only seize contraband of war: which is not
an accurate statement of the law. ‘Belligerent
right’ is clearly the common factor; a belligerent
has the right to declare what shall be contraband
of war; he has the right to declare a
blockade. The variant is the position and number
of ships he makes use of, the exhibition of sea-power
by which both rights are enforced. So we get
to this result: that when there is a cordon of
cruisers the belligerent may seize anything, but
when there are only isolated ships he may only
seize contraband of war.

<p>This test ceases to be rudimentary when we
introduce another factor common to the two
subjects—effectiveness. That the belligerent’s
naval dispositions must be capable of doing what
he proposes to do—in other words, must be effective
to that end—is no less a feature of the law of
contraband than it is of blockade. Carrying contraband
of war and blockade-running are not
offences; the evil consequences, which authors
insist on calling ‘penalty,’ result from capture.
Therefore in both cases what the belligerent <i>may</i>
do is only qualified by what he <i>can</i> do. That
sub-conscious recognition of the possibility that
a belligerent may put far greater impediments
in the way of neutral communications with his
enemy than is implied in the law of contraband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
becomes now the conscious principle which I
gave in outline in the first article: that ‘contraband
of war’ and ‘blockade’ are identical in
principle; that they are merely convenient names
given to varying exhibitions of sea-power against
the enemy, and the consequences, to enemy and
neutral merchant alike, do in fact depend on and
vary with the force exhibited—that is, with the
number and position of the ships employed upon
the service, which, if effectively performed, results
in both cases in seizure and condemnation.</p>

<p>Blockade in principle is, therefore, nothing more
than an indefinite extension of the list of contraband
of war, subject only to the requirement that
a sufficient number of ships should be placed in
such a position as to make this extended threat
of seizure effective. This then is practically what
the Order in Council does; and even if it insisted
on condemnation in all cases it would be justified,
for it satisfies the test which this analysis shows
to be the true test, and the only test, that the
ships employed upon the service, both as regards
number and position, shall be effective for its
due performance.</p>

<p>Now, seeing that the Order pays so great
regard to the pocket of the neutral merchant that
it does not condemn <i>his</i> non-contraband cargoes,
it is very difficult to discover any justification for
protest. Shorn of superfluity of words, the complaint
is that we have not declared a blockade;
and it resolves itself into this: that we ought
to seize and condemn neutral cargoes and not
rest satisfied with what may be termed an interim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
seizure, which may not become absolute. The
answer is that the existence and extent of a right
does not depend on the nature of the procedure
by which it is enforced. It is true that international
law has invented a fiction to assist the
belligerent who decides to declare a blockade; it
preserves, <i>as against the neutral merchant</i>, the ‘evident
danger of seizure’ even when owing to stress of
weather it has ceased not merely to be evident,
but to exist altogether. What can this fiction
have to do with the nature of the right to which
it is a mere adjunct? <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Changed from the">The</span> right to stop <i>all</i> supplies
going to the enemy. It is preposterous to say
that a belligerent cannot exercise this right unless
he avails himself of the adventitious assistance
which the law offers him; that although he <i>can</i>
do without it yet he <i>may</i> not.</p>

<p>What is true of the deep sea must also be true
of the high air. When the lorries and cargo-carriers
of the air have come into being, and the
war in the air becomes even more of a grim reality
than it is to-day, neutrals carrying supplies to
the enemy will, I imagine, receive short shrift,
contraband or no contraband, siege or no siege,
blockade or no blockade.</p>


<h3><i>The Sovereignty over Neutral Ships</i></h3>

<p>But the United States Government rests its
protest on an alternative ground. The Order in
Council, it declares,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>would constitute, were its provisions to be actually carried
into effect as they stand, a practical assertion of unlimited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
belligerent rights over neutral commerce within the
whole European area, and an almost unqualified denial
of the sovereign rights of the nations now at peace.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This Government takes it for granted that there
can be no question what those rights are. A nation’s
sovereignty over its own ships and citizens under its
own flag on the high seas in time of peace is, of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Changed from course;">course,</span>
unlimited. And that sovereignty suffers no diminution
in times of war except in so far as the practice and
consent of civilised nations have limited it by the recognition
of certain now clearly determined rights which it
is conceded may be exercised by nations which are at
war.</p>

<p>A belligerent nation has been conceded the right
of visit and search, and the right of capture and condemnation
if upon examination a neutral vessel is found
to be engaged in unneutral service or to be carrying
contraband of war intended for the enemy’s Government
or armed forces. It has been conceded the right to
establish and maintain a blockade of an enemy’s ports
and coasts, and to capture and condemn any vessel taken
in trying to break the blockade. It is even conceded the
right to detain and take to its own ports for judicial
examination all vessels which it suspects for substantial
reasons to be engaged in unneutral service, and to condemn
them if the suspicion is sustained. But such rights,
long clearly defined both in doctrine and practice, have
hitherto been held to be the only permissible exceptions
to the principle of equality of sovereignty on the high
seas as between belligerents and nations not engaged
in war.</p>
</div>

<p>If the rights of the neutral merchant are no
greater than I have stated them in the first article,
and he acts at his own peril and is entirely independent
of his own Government, and if the rights
of the belligerents are as large as I have there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
stated them, then it follows that there can be <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Changed from on">no</span>
question of ‘concession’ by the neutral merchant’s
Government, in regard to either contraband or
blockade, but only an assertion of belligerent right,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
and all questions as to the sovereignty of that
Government over its merchants’ ships disappear.
When the neutral merchant is carrying contraband,
or when he is blockade-running, he
deliberately runs his risk, and therefore cannot
claim the protection of his flag.</p>

<p>I think I am not overstating the case when I
say that the doctrine on which the United States
Government rests its case against us is the exact
opposite of this. The prominent position which
it holds in the Protest shows that it is regarded
as the key-stone of the argument, and that if that
key-stone is withdrawn the whole argument must
fall to pieces. At the risk of repetition I shall
quote again a passage from ‘Historicus,’ referred
to in the post-script to the first article, in which
he examines the terms of the British proclamations
of neutrality. Using his own language, ‘the
vital importance of this matter to the great issues’
which have arisen between the United States
and Great Britain, ‘must be my excuse....
The interests of peace demand that there should
be no doubt on this question.’ In these proclamations,
he says, the nature of the consequence,
commonly called a penalty, of trading in contraband
of war ‘is pointed out with equal clearness
and correctness—<i>viz.</i> the withdrawal of the Queen’s
protection from the contraband on its road to
the enemy, and an abandonment of the subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the operation of belligerent rights.’<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And again,
‘when the neutral Sovereign has withdrawn from
his subjects engaged in such a trade the protection
of his flag, he has discharged the whole duty of
neutrality.’<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> To withdraw protection from the
merchant when he sets out on his risky adventure,
to abandon him during his adventuring to the
exercise of sea-power by a belligerent which it is
admitted he must exercise because he is at war,
is inconsistent with any notion of <i>concession</i>. A
neutral vessel carrying contraband is in no better
case than if she wore no flag. The <i>fact of the
contraband being on board</i> withdraws her from her
national protection.</p>

<p>Further, the laws of the United States (which
may be taken as typical of neutral countries),
‘do not forbid their citizens to sell to either of the
belligerent Powers articles contraband of war, or to
take munitions of war ... on board their private
ships for <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Changed from transportation.">transportation.’</span><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It is impossible, therefore,
to say that the neutral Government—except
only when an embargo has been declared—exercises
jurisdiction over such private ships, for the
national law creates no offence which could give
jurisdiction. Therefore it is clear that the neutral
vessel by carrying contraband or running blockade
puts herself deliberately, and with the
acquiescence of her own Government, at the
mercy of the other belligerent, and submits to
the exercise of belligerent rights.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>The right of search might be looked on as a concession,
or an infringement of jurisdiction, in the
case of ships not carrying contraband. Yet even
this does not bear analysis; for, as ‘Historicus’
points out, ‘when a trade in contraband is notoriously
and extensively carried on, it exposes the
innocent as well as the guilty to suspicion and
search, and this is precisely why the Queen in
her proclamation of neutrality exhorts her subjects
to abstain from such a trade.’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The proclamation
in fact admits that this search of <i>all</i> vessels on
suspicion is an integral and inevitable part of the
right of search. It is not a concession, but only
the logical extension of the belligerent right to
capture contraband on neutral vessels, and to take
all steps necessary to attain that end. It is a
part of the belligerent right. This question does
not arise in connexion with blockade, for there
there is no search, and all things become contraband
of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>


<h3><i>The Doctrine of ‘Continuous Voyages’ and the
Order in Council</i></h3>

<p>But although I have been obliged to devote great
space to these preliminary subjects, the point of
the Protest is still to come. The condition attached
by the United States to its theory of the ‘long-distance
blockade’ is that free admission and
exit must be accorded ‘to all lawful traffic with
neutral ports through the blockading cordon.’
‘Lawful traffic,’ it is explained, ‘would of course
include all outward-bound traffic from the neutral
country, and all inward-bound traffic to the neutral
country except contraband in transit to the enemy.’
This must be read with a sentence which occurs
earlier in the Protest:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is confidently assumed that His Majesty’s Government
will not deny at once [<i>i.e.</i> presumably, ‘will at
once admit’] that it is a rule sanctioned by general
practice that, even though a blockade should exist and
the doctrine of contraband as to blockaded territory be
rigidly enforced, <i>innocent shipments may be freely transported
to and from the United States through neutral
countries to belligerent territory</i> without being subject to
the penalties of contraband traffic or breach of blockade,
much less to detention, requisition, or confiscation.</p>
</div>

<p>At last we have the real issue. Assume everything
in our favour: that our blockading cruisers
are rightly standing far out to sea; that we should
be justified in condemning the cargoes seized
instead of returning them to the persons lawfully
entitled thereto: the United States denies that
its own particular doctrine of ‘continuous voyages’
can apply to a ‘long-distance blockade.’ And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
here undoubtedly the books seem to be in its
favour, for the rule they give, embodied in Article
19 of the Declaration of London, is shortly this:
the doctrine of ‘continuous voyages’ does not
apply to a blockade. This is the logical consequence
of the principle to which I have already
referred; that the blockading forces must not bar
access to neutral ports, because the doctrine of
‘continuous voyages’ expressly deals with cargoes
on vessels bound for neutral ports. But it would
seem to follow that with the disappearance of the
offing from the definition of ‘blockade,’ and the
consequent legitimate interference with access to
neutral ports, the application of the doctrine of
‘continuous voyages’ must follow as a matter of
course. The fact is that the United States Government
has not fully counted the cost of its own
admission. As I have already shown, once the
theory of the ‘long-distance blockade’ is admitted
the principle of non-discrimination, a legal nicety
appurtenant to the old blockade, goes by the
board, because geography compels an involuntary
discrimination against neutral countries which are
outside the cordon; so it is clear that this other
principle of non-application of the doctrine of
‘continuous voyages’ to blockade must also go
by the board, because it is the result of principles
specially applicable to the old blockade.</p>

<p>The doctrine of ‘continuous voyages’ holds
no precious mystery; it never meant more than
this: that what the neutral trader cannot do
directly without running the risk of seizure and
condemnation he cannot do indirectly without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
running that risk. And whereas, as has been
shown, the right to blockade the enemy is in
principle no more than the right indefinitely
to extend the list of contraband of war against
the neutral trader, this must apply equally whether
cargoes are going directly or indirectly to the
enemy.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The discussion of narrow rules hinders the
clear vision of the things which are; and of these
the all-important one is that, call it by what name
you please, a belligerent <i>will</i>, whenever he has
the power, take the necessary steps to cut off
<i>all</i> supplies from the enemy; and he will cut them
off whether they are going by direct route or
indirectly through a neutral port. The old conditions
under which that power was exercised
have, it is agreed, passed away; the power, which
we call the right, remains. The Government of the
United States contends, on behalf of its merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
that they have the right to evade and therefore
to nullify that power by supplying the enemy,
indirectly and without risk, with those cargoes
which they cannot safely supply him with directly.
Surely the proposition is impossible on the face
of it. To call such cargoes ‘innocent’ is to beg
the question. The introduction of the atmosphere
and terms of the criminal law has done more
to fog the public comprehension of this branch of
international law than any inherent complexity
of the problems with which it deals. Yet here
it will serve to bring home the inaccuracy of the
American contention to the public mind; for
seizure and condemnation become a sort of retributive
penalty for the neutral merchant’s attempt
to evade what, to continue the language of law, the
belligerent has the right to command, by darkening
and disguising his real intention. Judged even
by this imperfect standard, the American Protest
has cut away the ground from its own contention.
The doctrine of ‘continuous voyages’ was accepted
because of its logical simplicity; and this simplicity
shows that it must extend and reinforce
every exhibition of sea-power by a belligerent against
his enemy; and its logic prevents the neutral merchant
from setting up any right, more especially
any right which is not only in conflict with the
belligerent right, but is based on deceit and needs
a cloak to hide its real meaning. The right he
claims is to send to the enemy those supplies
which the belligerent has declared his intention
and taken effective steps to deprive him of. If the
neutral merchant had such a right it would enable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
him to diminish the force of the belligerent blow,
to heal the stroke of the wound.</p>


<h3><i>Reprisals</i></h3>

<p>There has been much talk of retaliation. The
Order in Council has adopted the formula of the
first of the Orders in Council of 1807,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> that the action
of the enemy has given to His Majesty the ‘unquestionable
right of retaliation,’ and it has been
assumed, too readily as I venture to think, that
this is an admission that our action to-day falls
outside the principles sanctioned by international
law. The American newspapers have found apt
expression of their criticism in the ancient adage
‘Two wrongs do not make a right.’ And in the
Protest of the Government this sentence occurs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If the course pursued by the present enemies of Great
Britain should prove to be in fact tainted by illegality
and disregard of the principles of war sanctioned by enlightened
nations, it cannot be supposed, and the Government
does not for a moment suppose, that His Majesty’s
Government would wish the same taint to attach to their
own actions, or would cite such illegal acts as in any
sense or degree a justification for similar practices on
their part in so far as they affect neutral rights.</p>
</div>

<p>A comparison of the measures taken by the
Order in Council with those ordered by the German
Admiralty can hardly have been seriously intended;
yet to many this sentence seemed to be straining
diplomatic proprieties to their utmost limit. But
any irritation it may have caused has been blotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
out by the stern words of disapproval used by the
President in his recent Notes to Germany.</p>

<p>But the reference to retaliation cannot, as
it seems to me, be legitimately construed into
an admission of the illegality of the measures
decreed by the Order in Council. The utmost
that can be said of it is that it admits they are
exceptional. The Order of 1807 declared that
‘no vessel shall be permitted to trade from one
port to another, both French,’ and it was enforced
by seizure and confiscation of neutral vessels
which disregarded it. That and the other Orders
which countered Napoleon’s paper blockade of
the English coasts have been severely criticised;
but it is impossible to apply the same criticism
to an Order which omits the confiscation, and
on the contrary, expressly provides for the return
of both ship and cargo to the neutral merchant.
That the measures are exceptional may be freely
admitted, and to that extent they may be called
reprisals; but exceptional measures, even of reprisal,
are not necessarily illegal measures.</p>


<h3><i>The American Caveat</i></h3>

<p>The strangest part of the correspondence
remains to be noted. The United States Government,
in July, lodged a <i>caveat</i>, intimating that
it ‘will not recognise the validity of Prize Court
proceedings taken under restraints imposed by
British municipal law in derogation of the rights
of American citizens under international law.’
The Government has thus indicated the retaliatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
measures it proposes to take against Great
Britain; yet it has failed to see that the veiled
irony of the paragraph just quoted from the
Protest applies in its entirety to this reprisal.
In so far as it relates to executive action, it proposes
to accomplish the impossible. Prize Court
judgments are <i>in rem</i>; they pass property, and
if possession has followed not even the United
States Government can undo it, for there would
not be even a tenth point on which it could seize;
and if possession has not followed, Government
action would be brought up short by the law.
Further, in so far as it relates to judicial action,
the intention appears to be to give an instruction
to the American Courts how in the circumstances
they are to deal with the decisions of the English
Prize Courts. Thus the constitutional principle
of the independence of the Judiciary from the
Executive is put in jeopardy, and the Government
would again be brought up short by the
law. And in so far as it relates to the law itself,
the proposed action professes to decide favourably
to the present contention of the United States
a difficult and complicated question of law—whether
judgments based on a municipal law
which, it is alleged, is a violation of international
law are not entitled to recognition by foreign
Courts, more especially if they are judgments <i>in
rem</i>. Such a decision does not fall within the
province of the Executive, but only of the Courts.
So, as it was said aforetime in the British argument
in the Behring Sea Arbitration, to all and every
part of the different protests which have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
made against our action by the United States
Government, there is, with profound respect, ‘but
one answer—the Law.’</p>

<p>In an Editorial Note in the May number of
the <i>North American Review</i>, dealing with the
relations between Great Britain and the United
States after the detention of the <i>Wilhelmina</i>,
this sentence occurs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If we should once admit the right of the Allies to
forbid our sending foodstuffs to Germany, how could
we deny the justice of Germany’s insistence that we
should apply the same principle to England? And what
would happen to the English people then? Surely, too,
our British friends must realise that only the strictest
adherence to international law makes it possible for us to
furnish to the Allies the vast quantities of war munitions
without which they could not hope to win.</p>
</div>

<p>The great friendliness of its tone cannot but be
grateful to us; yet in this short sentence all the
fallacies and misconceptions of the real nature of
the neutral merchant’s position are concentrated.
I have endeavoured to show that we have claimed
to exercise a right which a fuller examination
of admitted principles shows to be entirely
warranted, that the only thing which stands in
the way of the prompt admission of its legality is
a popular conception of belligerent rights which
unduly confines them within limits which have
proved themselves to be impossible in modern
conditions of war. Law once was the handmaid
of commerce: she has long since become its
mistress. But what, for want of a better name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
we call international law is still in a state of servitude.
If its doctrines are to be treated as intelligible
they must be considered as a continuous
development springing from, and as the inevitable
consequence of, the first cause, that two nations
are at war. Then War becomes the key-note, subdominant,
dominant, leading note, every note of
the scale of action throughout the world, and the
neutral merchant cannot pitch the tune as it may
best suit his interests.</p>

<p>Is then the justification for the new procedure
of the Order in Council an ultimate reference to
Might is Right? Have I, following far behind
the United States Government in the strenuousness
of the law as I have formulated it, found also
a justification for the German who relies on Might
without troubling to assert the Right? Surely
not. I have striven to base the whole law and
every part of the law as it affects the neutral
merchant on the plain fact that all exercise of
might against the enemy, so long as it comes
within the laws of humanity and the rules of war,
is justifiable, and the omission of it mere folly,
and that it is not limited by considerations of
time and space; and on this still plainer fact
that the exercise of might against the enemy
engenders ‘right’ against such neutral merchants
as do, of their own free will and with eyes open,
bring themselves within the scope of it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P.S.—I have dealt with the subject on the
supposition that all contracts are made after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
declaration of war. But much foreign trade is
carried on by ‘long-distance’ contracts, and neutral
merchants who have entered into continuing contracts
before the War would seem to demand
special attention, for their eyes were not open,
and the risk of seizure by a belligerent has caught
them awares. Speaking generally, it is here that
the consideration shown to the neutral merchant
by Great Britain may find full scope for action.
But I admit quite frankly that so much of my
argument as is personal to the neutral merchant
does not apply to this category. On the other
hand, the law of contraband, with its adjunct
the doctrine of ‘continuous voyages,’ and the
law of blockade, as they have been understood
in the past, do not exempt them from the rigours
of their operation. Yet the fact remains that
the new development of the law does impose
upon them greater risks than they ran heretofore,
and a protest specially devoted to their
hard case would, I imagine, if it were limited
to contracts relating to non-contraband and to
contracts not made with the enemy Government,
receive careful consideration.</p>

</div>


<p>Raw cotton has been proclaimed contraband of
war.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> I may therefore fill in a blank space in
what I have written in the previous articles on
the law of contraband of war and the law of
blockade. It was obviously impossible while the
matter was, as it were, <i>sub judice</i>, to point the
moral of the doctrine advanced in those articles—which
I believe to be most sound doctrine—that
‘the right to blockade the enemy is in principle
no more than the right indefinitely to extend
the list of contraband of war against the neutral
trader,’<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> by a reference to the ‘cotton question.’
But I am free to do so now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>


<h3><i>Public Demand for Cotton to be made Contraband
of War</i></h3>

<p>I must confess that the movement, of which
the Proclamation is the outcome, in its later
stages has filled me with amazement; more
especially the way in which, the object attained,
the announcement of its issue has been received.
A sigh of relief has gone up: ‘At last!’ it is said,
‘the Government has given way, and the step
has been taken which should have been taken
at the beginning of the War.’ There is a gratified
assumption that those who have fought the good
fight have triumphed over a stubborn lot of procrastinating
and incompetent Ministers. Some
even suggested, when the decision was announced,
that a wicked Government might, after all, only
make cotton conditional contraband, for was it
not a Government prone to subterfuge?</p>

<p>The leaders in the fight, the distinguished
chemists, are so eminent that I refrain from applying
to them the term ‘agitators’; they are so
eminent that I am sure they will bear with me
patiently while I explain why, even though they
appear to have accomplished it, they were trying
to shut a door that was already closed, for ‘sweet
reasonableness’ is an attribute of all eminence. It
is not necessary now to inquire what were the
reasons which induced the Government to refrain
from putting cotton on the list of absolute contraband
during the first six months of the War; it was
a policy deliberately adopted by responsible Ministers;
whether it was the right or the wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
policy is not the question which the leaders of
the movement have put in issue. The errors of
the past were at length to be retrieved.</p>

<p>By the Order in Council of the 11th of March,
a new policy was adopted which, in the opinion of
the present Government, should have been effective
to achieve what all desire—the prevention, by all
possible legitimate means of warfare, of cotton, as
well as everything else, from reaching Germany.
This was intimated in Lord Moulton’s answer of
the 19th March to the distinguished chemists who
had moved in the matter;<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and it was more fully
explained by Lord Robert Cecil in the House of
Commons in August. It is that policy which
has been so vehemently attacked as insufficient,
as part of our ‘sorry record in the cotton question.’
It was contended that in spite of the far-reaching
effect of the Order in Council it was necessary
further to reinforce the powers taken under it by
putting cotton on the list of contraband of war;
and the Government have now done what they
were asked to do.</p>

<p>The criticism of the Government took two
forms, one of which was serious. The other may
be dealt with summarily. It was to the effect that
the Order in Council ought to be revoked because,
so it was said, many lawyers considered it to be
contrary to international law, and that it should
be replaced by some provision dealing specially
with cotton. I have endeavoured in the preceding
articles to show that this opinion of my learned
brothers, if indeed they hold it, is erroneous. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
putting this on one side, I believe the sound and
only rule of speech and of the pen for Englishmen
while the War lasts to be <i>omnia præsumuntur rite
esse acta</i>. Criticism, based on learning or otherwise,
of action taken by the Government against
the enemy is out of place in time of war. The fact
that such action affects neutral merchants injuriously
does not justify criticism, for whatever
weight it may have, by so much it adds to the
difficulties, already immense, of temperate discussion
with neutral Governments; by so much
it heartens the enemy who seeks <i>per nefas</i> to
render the discussion intemperate. For the present,
therefore, at least a judicious silence is the better
and the wiser part.</p>

<p>But criticism of inaction of the Government in
regard to the enemy stands on a different footing,
and, so only that it conform to one condition,
it is permissible. That condition is the not unimportant
one—full knowledge of all the facts. The
eminent chemists and others who have been so
vehemently urging the Government to make cotton
contraband of war were critics of alleged inaction,
and so far their position was unimpeachable;
but, I venture with respect to ask them, did they
know <i>all</i> the facts? They certainly knew one
fact—that, at the time they approached the
Government, Germany was getting too much cotton;
and realising the intimate connexion between this
and the ever-growing lists of casualties they were
deeply stirred, as all of us who are condemned
to sit at home at ease were deeply stirred when we
came to understand. But emotion is apt to cloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
clear mental vision, and we have been asked
by some persons to believe that those others,
men like ourselves, who form the Government of
the nation, having eyes yet see not the plain things
that are going on before them. And yet those
are the only men among us who know <i>all</i> the
facts. The critical point, however, is not whether
Germany has been getting too much cotton, but
whether she has been getting it because the Government
had not taken sufficiently strenuous measures
to prevent it. This being assumed in the affirmative,
these eminent critics further assumed that
declaring cotton to be contraband would be more
effective in preventing it from getting to Germany
than the procedure authorised by the Order in
Council.</p>


<h3><i>The Answer to the Critics of the Government</i></h3>

<p>None of us know what is actually happening
on the high seas in the area controlled by our
cruiser squadrons, though the statistics just published
by the Foreign Office somewhat lift the veil.
We cannot, therefore, do more than consider the
abstract question of principle, whether it was
necessary to supplement the Order in Council by a
proclamation of contraband so as more effectually
to prevent cotton getting through to Germany; and
it seems to me essential to a right understanding
of the discussion that we should consider it.</p>

<p>Now there is one fact which I should have
thought would at once have disposed of the whole
contention of the critics—the Protest of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
States Government. That Protest declares that
in the Order in Council we have gone to lengths in
interfering with American trade (which includes
trade in cotton) hitherto unknown to international
law, more especially in stopping that trade, asserted
to be ‘innocent’ but manifestly the opposite, on
its way to neutral countries. In all friendliness
that Government exhorts us, among other things,
to revert to the time-honoured practice of relying
on declarations of contraband. It appears, therefore,
that the United States Government charges us
with doing precisely what our own critics condemn
Ministers for not doing, except by ‘a half-hearted
expedient’—stopping ‘innocent’ cargoes of cotton.
That Government insists that the correct way of
preventing cotton reaching the enemy is to shut
ourselves up in those old watertight compartments
of international law labelled ‘contraband’
and ‘blockade.’ They want to entangle us in that
incomprehensible ravel of illogic into which those
doctrines of international law have got themselves.
Paraphrased, what the American Government says
is this—declare a blockade, even though it be a
‘long-distance blockade,’ which they are willing
to concede to be our right, and then we may stop all
cotton going direct to German ports, though not,
as the text-books point out, cotton going indirectly
to Germany through neutral ports; or, declare
cotton to be contraband, and then we may stop
it even though it passes through neutral ports.
But as we had done neither of these things <i>in
express terms</i>, Germany must be allowed to get
her ‘innocent’ shipments of cotton by way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
neutral and contiguous ports. Verily, the American
fowler spreads the net in the sight of the British
bird.</p>

<p>Here is the substance of the whole discussion.
The Judges of the United States, with clear-cut
thought, declared, half a century ago, that the
doctrine of ‘continuous voyages’ was the inevitable
complement to the belligerent right of stopping
munitions of war and their component substances
on the high seas on the way to the enemy. In
other words, that the doctrine completed the law
of contraband of war. The British Government,
has, by the Order in Council, declared that doctrine
equally to be the inevitable complement to the
more extended belligerent right of stopping <i>all</i>
supplies from reaching the enemy. In other words,
that the doctrine completes the law of what we
have called the ‘new blockade.’</p>

<p>This, then, is the clear issue raised by the
Order in Council for the judgment of any tribunal,
national or international, to which it may hereafter
be submitted, and of the world to which
it is now submitted. And the position is, in my
humble judgment, and in spite of the critics
on our own side, unassailable. Nations, no more
than individuals, are not to be bound by mere
phraseology, especially in such a subject as this,
without knowing what the terms used mean.
‘Blockade’ is a mere term, explaining what belligerent
nations do, but not why they do it nor
why neutral nations silently acquiesce.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It tells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
nothing of the right to do it. On the contrary
it seems, for a hundred years, to have successfully
blinded men by its technical conditions to the
fact that the so-called right to declare a blockade
is no more than a declaration of an intention
by a belligerent to stop <i>all</i> supplies from going
to the enemy, and stopping them. Is it not
abundantly clear that that intention cannot be
nullified by the cleverness of the neutral merchant
in ‘darkening and disguising’ the fact that they
are going to the enemy? That, then, we have
declared by the Order in Council to be our intention,
and we have acted on it. It may be that, in
regard to cotton, we have exercised it imperfectly;
some neutral merchants may have successfully
evaded the vigilance of our ships. Human agencies
are never quite perfect; of all, even though
they be official, Rostand’s philosophy is, alas! too
true:</p>

<p>
Sache donc cette triste et rassurante chose,<br>
Que nul, Coq du matin ou Rossignol du soir,<br>
N’a tout-à-fait le chant qu’il rêverait d’avoir.<br>
</p>

<p>But because the ingenuity of the neutral
merchant and his confederates has, as it is said, so
far greatly baffled the vigilance of the mightiest
fleet that ever stood guard upon the sea, the
critics of the Government protest that we should
fall back on the lesser remedy of declaring cotton
contraband, and revoke, abandon, or ignore the
more strenuous remedy provided by the Order in
Council. It is difficult to appreciate the position
these critics take up; it can only be explained by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
a lack of understanding of the real meaning of the
Order. This these articles have endeavoured to do.</p>

<p>But, curiously enough, there is just one point
where the combined operation of the laws of
contraband and of blockade <i>may</i> increase our
power of seizing cotton. It follows from what I
have said in the second article with reference
to the importance of reducing both laws to a
common denomination of language,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> that the reinforcement
of even our ‘long-distance blockade’
by the addition of cotton to the list of absolute
contraband will enable us to seize cargoes of
cotton by isolated cruisers before the neutral
ships which carry them reach the area in which
the cordon of cruisers is operating. If this is
a valuable power, as to which I am sceptical, it
is right that it should be claimed and exercised;
and it is one of the powers which result from the
new Proclamation. I feel sure that the critics
of the Government had not this addition to our
powers solely in their minds; they certainly did
not so formulate their criticism.</p>

<p>But the action which the critics wanted the
Government to take has been taken; and I think
the reason may not be far to seek. The American
merchant, like his Government, believes that there
is much virtue in technical terms. He says ‘put
cotton on the list of absolute contraband; I know
what that means; then I shall know where I
am.’ I pointed out in the first article that the
problem of the neutral trader is a very complex
one, ‘for each belligerent as a buyer must strive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
to keep him in a good humour, but as a fighter
must do all he can to thwart him.’<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The cotton-grower
of the Southern States prefers to be thwarted
in this manner, and the British Government has
humoured him. He prefers the risk of confiscation
to the possibility of having his cargo returned
to him if he is ‘the lawful owner thereof.’ So
all is well.</p>

<p>The comments which have appeared since the
Proclamation was issued have laid much stress
on the deterrent effect it is bound to have on
the cotton shippers, because the Order in Council
does not provide for confiscation of cargoes of
non-contraband, whereas now that cotton is contraband
it must be confiscated. Also the complaint
has been revived that the Order in Council was
loosely enforced, and it is imagined that the
declaration of contraband will of itself ensure
a stricter supervision of cargoes of cotton at
sea. It is difficult to follow either arguments,
even on the supposition that this latter criticism
is justified. For the machine by which both
the Order in Council and the contraband Proclamation
must be carried out is the same—the Fleet.
The effectiveness of this machine, the efficiency
of the Fleet, is obviously the dominating factor
of the situation, whether it be governed by
the Order or by the Proclamation. The deterrent
nature of the fact that confiscation is now
inevitable may possibly reduce the number
of cargoes of cotton with which the Fleet may
have to deal, but the other fact remains, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the Fleet will deal with them whatever may be
their number.</p>

<p>There has also been, even in very responsible
quarters, some rather confused talk to the effect
that the result of the contraband Proclamation
is to ‘improve our international legal position.’
If this means anything it implies acquiescence
in the American argument that the Order in
Council is not warranted by international law.
Such an argument, as I have already said, is
more than inopportune at the present time;
those who use it would, I presume, be pleased
to see the Order in Council revoked altogether.
I trust, on the other hand, that nothing that I
have said will be construed to suggest that the
Government in yielding to the clamour of the
critics has issued a futile Proclamation. Yet it
is impossible to imagine that Ministers have lost
faith in the virtue and efficacy of the Order in
Council. The latest statement in Parliament, by
Lord Robert Cecil, which I have already referred
to, shows that they have not. The Proclamation
does, as I have shown, strengthen the position in
some slight measure; but there is a well-known
form of legislation often resorted to ‘for the
quieting of doubts,’ which does not give away
the situation. Such I believe this Proclamation
to be.</p>

<p>But for the sake of the science of international
law, in the preservation of which both the British
and the American Governments are profoundly
interested: for the sake of that cardinal principle
that as weapons of war increase in their power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of destruction so must the belligerent might and
right also increase, and new means must be found
for keeping the new manifestations of sea-power
within the old principles: for the sake of our
duty of loyal belief that the Order in Council has
devised those means in most legitimate fashion,
let not the critics of the Government, learned or
unlearned though they be, lay the flattering
unction to their souls that they have won a famous
victory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P.S.—I take this opportunity of referring to
the American reply to the Austrian Note which
complained that the sale of munitions of war by
United States merchants to the Allies was a breach
of neutrality on the part of the United States
Government. The Note was in the forcible-feeble
style. It gave me the impression of having been
written to order of the German Government by
men who had not much belief in the soundness
of their argument. It very clearly showed that
necessity ‘knows no law,’ for erroneous doctrine
was assuredly never so weakly stated. But it
gave President Wilson an occasion of finally
disposing of the false, and of asserting the true,
principles of neutrality. It disposes also of the
notion prevalent in some quarters, to which I
referred in the second article, that the President’s
‘sense of fairness’<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> had something to do with our
continuing to receive munitions of war from the
United States. The reply has not been much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
noticed, but it deserves transcription as a most
masterly statement of law and policy: ‘The
principles of international law, the practice of
nations, the national safety of the United States
and other nations without great military and naval
establishments, the prevention of increased armies
and navies, the adoption of peaceful methods
for the adjustment of international differences,
and, finally, neutrality itself, are opposed to the
prohibition by a neutral nation of the exportation
of arms and ammunition or other munitions of
war to belligerent Powers during the progress of
the War.’</p>

<p>I draw special attention to the sentence ‘the
national safety of the United States and other
nations without great military and naval establishments’;
these are the nations, small in their
powers of defence, who, as I have pointed out,
must go to the wall if the wild dream of neutralizing
the sea should ever be allowed to materialise.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

upon by the High Contracting Parties as rules to be taken as applicable to the case, and
by such principles of international law not inconsistent therewith as the Arbitrators

to use due diligence to prevent the fitting out, arming, or equipping, within its jurisdiction,
of any vessel which it has reasonable ground to believe is intended to cruise or to carry
on war against a Power with which it is at peace; and also to use like diligence to prevent
the departure from its jurisdiction of any vessel intended to cruise or carry on war as above,
such vessel having been specially adapted, in whole or in part, within such jurisdiction, to
warlike uses. Secondly, not to permit or suffer either belligerent to make use of its ports
or waters as the base of naval operations against the other, or for the purpose of the renewal
or augmentation of military supplies or arms, or the recruitment of men. Thirdly, to exercise
due diligence in its own ports and waters, and, as to all persons within its jurisdiction,
to prevent any violation of the foregoing obligations and duties. Her Britannic Majesty has
commanded Her High Commissioners and Plenipotentiaries to declare that Her Majesty’s Government
 cannot assent to the foregoing rules as a statement of principles of international law which
were in force at the time when the claims mentioned in Article 1 arose, but that Her Majesty’s
Government, in order to evince its desire of strengthening the friendly relations between the
two countries and of making satisfactory provision for the future, agrees that in deciding the
questions between the two countries arising out of those claims, the
Arbitrators should assume that Her Majesty’s Government had undertaken
to act upon the principles set forth in these rules. And the High
Contracting Parties agree to observe these rules as between themselves
in future, and to bring them to the knowledge of other maritime Powers,
and to invite them to accede to them.’</p>

prevent the export or transit, for either belligerent, of arms, munitions
of war, or, in general, of anything which could be of use to an army or
fleet.’ The full meaning of this article is made specially clear by its
juxtaposition with Article 6, which provides that ‘The supply, in any
manner, directly or indirectly, of war-ships, supplies, or war material
of any kind whatever, by a neutral Power to a belligerent Power, is
forbidden.’</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> <i>Letters of Historicus</i>, p. 121:—‘The recent unfortunate evasion of the
<i>Alabama</i> has given rise to much discussion on the general duty of a neutral
Government with respect to the trade of its own subjects with the belligerents
in contraband of war. One might have supposed that if there
were any question which the authority of accredited writers, the definitions
of public documents, and the universal practice of nations, had
clearly and decisively ascertained, it was this very question on which,
unhappily, there seems to prevail a most general and unfortunate misapprehension.
This misapprehension, grave as it is in the exasperation
which it is calculated to produce between friendly nations, is not altogether
inexplicable. We have the misfortune to live in days when, in
the name of liberalism, philanthropy, and civilisation, we are invited to
upset the whole fabric of international law which the reason of jurists
has designed and the usage of nations has built up, and to rear upon its
ruins the trumpery edifice of a shallow caprice. It is the old story of
that pretentious philosophy which, by a recurrence to first principles,
attempted with so little success to operate the regeneration of mankind.
I would that we had yet among us the multitudinous eloquence of Burke
or the poignant wit of Canning to do condign justice upon this presumptuous
sciolism.’</p>

in time of peace.</p>

any prohibition than that of transportation of contraband goods to an
enemy? No nation, not even the most powerful, or those who could, with
impunity, exercise the right of the strongest, have ventured, in their
declarations of war, dictated by the most violent animosity, to prohibit
neutrals from the impartial sale of any goods in their own territory. They
have confined themselves to the threat of confiscating contraband articles
which should be found clearly destined to the enemy.”’</p>

debate on the Terceira affair in 1830, cites the opinion of Mr. Canning to
the following effect (<i>Hansard</i>, vol. xxiv., N.S., p. 209):—</p>

<p>‘“Arms may leave this country as a matter of merchandise, and however
strong the general inconvenience, the law cannot interfere to stop
them. It is only when the elements of armaments are combined that
they come within the provision of the law, and if that combination does
not take place till they have left this country, we have no right to interfere
with them.” These are the words of Mr. Canning, who extended the
doctrine to steam-vessels and yachts that might afterwards be converted
into vessels of war, and they appeared quite consistent with the law of
nations. At the very moment he was speaking, arms and clothing were
about to be sent out of this country to belligerents. Were they to be
stopped, or were they to be followed and brought back? He believed
the answer would be, No; and if it were Yes, of what use, he would ask,
would be our skill in building ships, manufacturing arms, and preparing
instruments of war, if equally to sell them to all belligerents were a breach
of neutrality?’</p>

grounded on true principles, that the Powers at war may seize and confiscate
all contraband goods, without any complaint on the part of the
neutral merchant, and without any imputation of a breach of neutrality
in the neutral Sovereign himself. It was contended on the part of the
French nation, in 1796, that neutral Governments were bound to restrain
their subjects from selling or exporting articles contraband of war to the
belligerent Powers. But it was successfully shown, on the part of the
United States, that neutrals may lawfully sell, at home, to a belligerent
purchaser, or carry themselves to the belligerent Powers, contraband
articles, subject to the right of seizure <i>in transitu</i>. This right has since
been explicitly declared by the judicial authorities of this country. The
right of the neutral to transport, and of the hostile Power to seize, are
conflicting rights, and neither party can charge the other with a criminal
act.’ (<i>Commentaries</i>, vol. i., p. 142.)</p>

<p>‘The true doctrine is enforced with singular clearness and force by
President Pierce, in his Message of December, 1854:—</p>

<p>“The laws of the United States do not forbid their citizens to sell to
either of the belligerent Powers articles contraband of war, or to take
munitions of war or soldiers on board their private ships for transportation;
and although in so doing the individual citizen exposes his property
to some of the hazards of war, his acts do not involve any breach of
national neutrality, nor of themselves implicate the Government. Thus,
during the progress of the present war in Europe, our citizens have,
without national responsibility, therefore, sold gunpowder and arms to
all buyers, regardless of the destination of those articles. Our merchantmen
have been, and still continue to be, largely employed by Great Britain
and France in transporting troops, provisions, and munitions of war, to
the principal seat of military operations, and in bringing home the sick
and wounded soldiers; but such use of our mercantile marine is not
interdicted, either by international or by our municipal law, and, therefore,
does not compromise our neutral relations with Russia.”’</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> The real issue <i>must</i> be understood, or we shall find ourselves in a
blind alley. The case <i>must</i> be put as strongly as I have put it. The
Washington correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, writing on July 19, full of
anxious solicitude at the gravity of the situation, assuming us to misunderstand
it, said: ‘It is all very well to trust to the President’s sense of
fairness to prevent the closing of American sources of supply of munitions of
war. We can surely do so with perfect safety.’ In the prevalence of this
view of the case lies the gravest danger. Once admit that ‘fairness’ has in
any shape or form anything to do with the matter, we open the flood-gates
of Teuton eloquence, and, to use the conventional expression, the President
must be a strong man to resist it. The question must be looked at from
a higher standpoint; and it cannot be put more strongly or tersely than
it was by Mr. Bryan in his letter to Mr. Stone in January: ‘It is the
business of belligerent operations on the high seas, not the duty of a
neutral, to prevent contraband from reaching the enemy.... If Germany
and Austria-Hungary cannot import contraband from this country it
is not because of that fact the duty of the United States to close its markets
to the Allies.’</p>

recorded an extract from Herr Dernburg’s speech at a Republican club
in America.</p>

<p>An enlightening and interesting commentary on the sincerity of the
German diatribes against the United States for ‘helping Germany’s
enemies’ is furnished by the fact that, during the rebellion in China in 1913,
the rebels in the Southern Provinces obtained large supplies of arms from
German firms in Shanghai. The German Government took no steps to
prevent its subjects ‘helping the enemies’ of the Republic; on the
contrary, it joined, so it was reported, in protesting against the Chinese
Government exercising in self-defence its undoubted right of search and
seizure of cargoes of arms which it knew were being smuggled into the
Settlement in order to be handed over to the agents of the rebel leaders.

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> As an illustration of the scrupulous exactitude of the appeal to
principles by President Wilson in his recent Notes to Germany, I may
refer to the distinction he draws in the Note of June 11, between the
duty of a neutral Government to enforce its own laws in regard to granting
clearances to vessels carrying cargo prohibited by those laws, and the
grant of clearances to vessels carrying contraband of war: ‘Performing
its recognised duty as a neutral Power and enforcing its natural laws,
it was its [<i>i.e.</i> the Government of the United States] duty to see to it
that the <i>Lusitania</i> was not armed for offensive action, that she was not
serving as a transport, that she did not carry cargo prohibited by the
statutes of the United States, and that if, in fact, she was a naval vessel
of Great Britain she should not receive clearance as a merchantman.
It performed that duty. It enforced its statutes with scrupulous vigilance
through its regularly constituted officials....’ The performance of
these express duties is treated as distinct from the contention of the
German Government that the carriage of contraband of war was a
violation of American law.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
